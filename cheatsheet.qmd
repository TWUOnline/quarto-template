### Blockquotes

### Accordions

<details>
  <summary><strong>This is an Accordion.</strong></summary>
  <div>An accordion may contain extra content such as worked examples or sample answers. Accordions should be used sparingly. </div>
</details>

### Images

Images are handled differently depending on if they are fig-images (figures) or dec-images (decorative).

#### Fig-image {.unnumbered}

- Should contain a caption
- Should have a unique fig id (*"#fig-u1_1"*)
- You can reference any fig-image by its unique fig id from anywhere in the course
    - (example: @fig-u1_1)
- Should contain alt text
- Should contain source metadata (at least source-text)
- May use a lightbox.
    - Adding a lightbox makes the image expandable with a click or tap.

::: {#fig-image}
![](assets/cheatsheet/cat.jpg){#fig-u1_1 .lightbox fig-alt="Cat Sitting on a Wooden Table"}

This is a caption for a fig-image

#### Dec-image {.unnumbered}

- Should not contain a caption
- Should not have a fig id
- Should contain alt text as 'Decorative'
- Should contain source metadata (at least source-text)
- May use a lightbox.
    - Adding a lightbox makes the image expandable with a click or tap. Generally this is not necessary with a decorative image.

#### Figure Blocks

Below is a figure block containing 2 fig-images. It has a 2 column layout, so the 2 images will appear side by side.

::: {#fig-block_u1_1 layout-ncol="2"}

![This is a caption for the first fig-image](assets/cheatsheet/tram.jpg){#fig-u1_2 .lightbox fig-alt="Red Tram" source-text="Vintage Red Tram on Streets of Prague" source-link="https://www.pexels.com/photo/vintage-red-tram-on-streets-of-prague-28999320/" source-author="Aakash Goel" source-author-link="https://www.pexels.com/@ohaakash/" source-copyright="2022, Aakash Goel" source-license-text="Pexels License" source-license-link="https://www.pexels.com/license/"}

This is the caption of the figure block

### Tables

Below is a table. All tables should be contained within a figure block. Figures containg tables should not use columns.

::: {#fig-table_u1_1}

| Month | Savings |
|----------|---------|
| January | \$250 |
| February | \$80 |
| March | \$420 |

### Learning Activites

You can set the estimated time of an activity. If you do not set the time, the field will not display.

### Activity: Title of the Activity

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}

This is a learning activity containing an h5p activity. It has an estimated time set to 20 minutes.

**Questions to Consider**

1. Is this a question?
2. Is this a second question?

### Case Study Example {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip .case-study icon=false appearance="simple"}

It is unnumbered, so it won't interfer with activities numbering, but display on the right hand side as part of the table of content.

This design is created for case study intention, but open to other usage.

:::

### Quiz Example {.unnumbered}

We create Quarto quizzes in replacement to H5P quizzes or PDF format. It is manual work, so please send in content early. For next iteration, we will add a carousell format to it.

Please note that the quiz response is not saved. Below is a shortened version. For existing course examples, see LDRS 504 [5.2.2](https://twuonline.github.io/ldrs504/u5.html#activity-team-assessment){target="_blank"} and [5.5.1](https://twuonline.github.io/ldrs504/u5.html#activity-self-assessment-promoting-ethical-group-interactions){target="_blank"}. 

::: learning-activity
**Instructions:** For each statement below, rate how often you personally engage in or observe these behaviours in your groups or teams. Use this scale:

**1 = Rarely or never**<br>
**2 = Sometimes**<br>
**3 = Often**<br>
**4 = Almost always**

::: {.webex-check .webex-box .average-enabled}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(htmltools)
library(webexercises)
# statements
qs <- c(
    "Listen carefully to others, seeking to fully understand their message, including emotions and intent, before responding.",
    "I avoid communication that makes others feel defensive, such as criticizing or controlling language.",
    "I am aware of my own emotions during group interactions and try to manage them constructively.",
    "I encourage open discussion of different viewpoints, even when there is disagreement or conflict.",
    "I welcome and respect minority opinions or dissenting views in group decisions."
)


# Likert labels; we name every option "answer" so webexercises marks it as selectable/correct,
# while the *score* comes only from the points vector we pass.
likert_labels <- c(
    "Rarely or never",
    "Sometimes",
    " Often",
    "Almost always"
)
likert_opts <- stats::setNames(likert_labels, rep("answer", length(likert_labels)))

# emit each item + longmcq with points
for (i in seq_along(qs)) {
    pts <- 1:4

    cat(
        sprintf("<p><strong>%d.</strong> %s</p>\n", i, htmltools::htmlEscape(qs[i])),
        longmcq(likert_opts, points = pts),
        "<hr/>",
        sep = ""
    )
}

```

**How to Interpret Your Results**

**Step 1: Calculate Your Average Score**

Add your scores for all 5 statements and divide them by 5 to find your average.

**Step 2: Reflect on Your Average**

| **Average Score** | **Interpretation** | **Reflection Questions** |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **3.5 – 4.0** | **Consistently Ethical** |  |
| You regularly practice behaviours that promote ethical and effective group interactions. Keep reinforcing these strengths! | What specific habits help you maintain this level? How can you support others in your group? |  |
| **2.5 – 3.4** | **Moderate Practice** |  |
| You sometimes engage in these ethical behaviours but there is room for growth. | Which areas do you notice the most inconsistency? What small changes can you make to improve? |  |
| **1.0 – 2.4** | **Needs Attention** |  |
| You rarely or only occasionally use these behaviours, which may hinder ethical group dynamics. | What barriers prevent you from practicing these behaviours? What support or resources would help you develop them? |  |

**Step 3: Look at Individual Items** Identify any statements where you scored below 3. These might be key focus areas to develop, as they represent critical aspects of ethical group interaction.

**Step 4: Set a Personal Goal** Choose one or two behaviours to focus on strengthening in your next group experience. Consider how you might apply supportive communication, emotional intelligence, or encourage minority opinions more actively.

**Reflection Questions (Optional)**

-   Which of these areas do you feel strongest in?
-   Which areas could you improve to promote more ethical group interactions?
-   How might you practice supportive communication or encourage productive conflict in your next team meeting?

### Tabs

Tabs are only compatible with content displayed on Quarto site, not Moodle.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Tab A

![](assets/cheatsheet/nature.jpg){height="500" .lightbox}

Artists have an uncanny ability to make things seem real. The potential for ‘trompe-l’oeil’ like this train coming out of the wall seemed as dangerous to the ancients as portraying something imperfectly and thus damaging our understanding of it. Art is out of control!

### Tab B

![](assets/cheatsheet/cat.jpg){width="500"}

Some ancients believed art functioned like a false front, only showing part of something or being inherently deceitful.

### Summary

::: check

**Before you move on to the next unit you may want to check that you are able to:**

- Describe the place of leadership in results
- Explain the discipline of results-based leadership
- Contrast a team-based leadership style with other approaches to leadership
