## Images

Images are handled differently depending on if they are fig-images (figures) or dec-images (decorative).

### Fig-image {.unnumbered}

- Should contain a caption
- Should have a unique fig id (*"#fig-u1_1"*)
- You can reference any fig-image by its unique fig id from anywhere in the course
    - (example: @fig-u1_1)
- Should contain alt text
- Should contain source metadata (at least source-text)
- May use a lightbox.
    - Adding a lightbox makes the image expandable with a click or tap.
