# Course Assessment {.unnumbered}

## Assessment Overview {.unnumbered}

Below you will find the assignment dropboxes for submitting your assignments in this course. Make sure to read the instructions carefully in both your syllabus and below. Additionally, take note of the grading rubrics for your assessments, which provide clear expectations for assignments and insight into how the instructor will evaluate your work.

## Assignment Feedback & Outcome-Based Assessment {.unnumbered}

Your progress in this course will be assessed based on how well you demonstrate proficiency in the course learning outcomes (CLOs), which are equally weighted. Rather than focusing on point-based grading, this course uses an outcome-based assessment approach, which means:

-   You will complete a series of learning activities and assignments that provide opportunities to demonstrate your understanding of the CLOs.
-   Your work will be evaluated holistically, considering how well you meet the learning outcomes rather than simply accumulating points.
-   You will be asked to exercise evaluative judgment, meaning you will reflect on your own work, assess your level of proficiency, and provide evidence of your learning.
-   Your instructor will work with you to appraise your progress, offering feedback to help you deepen your understanding and refine your work.

To measure proficiency, we use a proficiency scale that helps both learners and instructors assess whether assignments are completed at an appropriate level. This scale includes five levels of proficiency: Not Demonstrated, Emerging, Developing, Proficient, and Extending. Each level reflects the depth of understanding and application of the course learning outcomes.

This approach ensures that assessment is focused on growth, reflection, and mastery rather than simply grading tasks.

| Not Demonstrated | Emerging | Developing | Proficient | Extending |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| The learner does not demonstrate the outcome at a level that is assessable. | The student demonstrates an initial understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning. | The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning. | The student demonstrates a complete understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning. | The student demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning. |

Feedback will be communicated with you in two different ways. First, and most important, there will be at least two **assessment interviews** that you will be required to attend with your instructor. During this assessment interview, you will need to highlight what you have learned and which artifacts from the course you use as evidence of your learning. You and your instructor will use the Personal Learning Tracker to guide this conversation. By the end of the conversation, you will have a clear picture and record of your level of proficiency on each of the Course Learning Outcomes addressed in that particular assignment and you will have a plan for improving your level of proficiency on future assignments.

Second, your instructor will record your level of proficiency on each outcome in the Moodle gradebook. It will be your responsibility to ensure that the proficiency levels shown in the Personal Learning Tracker align with what is shown in the gradebook. During the course, the Moodle Gradebook will be considered the correct record. However, your grade is not official until it is entered into the university Portal at the end of your course.

## Grading System {.unnumbered}

### Understanding Proficiency Levels and Final Grades

As we mentioned previously, your progress will be assessed based on how well you demonstrate proficiency on the Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). Instead of focusing on points or percentages, this approach emphasizes your ability to apply what you’ve learned.

Your proficiency will be evaluated at different levels, and your final grade will be based on your performance across all seven CLOs.

**You must complete all assignments to receive a grade in this course.**

There are two steps to determining your final grade in the course.

#### Proficiency Levels: Determining Your Learning Progress

First, at the end of your course, you will have a record of your proficiency levels on each of the Course Learning Outcomes based on your work on each of the assignments. In LDRS 101, you will have three proficiency ratings for outcomes 1-7 and two proficiency ratings for outcomes 5-7. Based on that data, your instructor will determine a final rating for each outcome based on all of your attempts. The following guidelines outline how the final proficiency rating may be determined. Given the developmental nature of learning, your instructor may prioritise demonstrations of proficiency that come later in the course.

-   **Extending** – You must achieve an *Extending* rating on at least two assessments.

-   **Proficient** – You must achieve a *Proficient* rating on at least two assessments.

-   **Developing** – You must achieve a *Developing* rating on at least two assessments.

-   **Emerging** – You must achieve an *Emerging* rating on at least two assessments.

-   **Not Demonstrated** – If two or more CLOs are rated as Not Demonstrated, this level is assigned.

#### Final Letter Grade Aggregation

Second, based on their final rating for each of the outcomes, your instructor will use the following information to determine your final grade.

Your final letter grade is determined by your proficiency across the seven CLOs:

-   **A** – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at **Extending**, with no rating below Proficient.

-   **B** – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at **Proficient**, with no rating below Developing.

-   **C** – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at **Developing**, with no rating below Emerging.

-   **D** – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at **Emerging**, with no Not Demonstrated ratings.

-   **F** – Assigned if 2 or more CLOs are rated as **Not Demonstrated**.

This grading structure ensures that your final grade reflects your overall proficiency across the course learning outcomes, rewarding both depth and consistency in your learning. It is designed to keep you actively engaged in your learning and focused on developing the skills necessary for success. If you have any questions about how your work is assessed, please reach out to your instructor.

## Assessment Conversations {.unnumbered}

Throughout the course, you will have several opportunities to elicit feedback from your instructor. We will work together to appraise your work on learning activities and assignments in light of the course learning outcomes.

As part of this process, you will participate in an Assessment Conversation, a scheduled meeting where you will:

-   **Demonstrate and discuss your work**, showcasing how you have engaged with digital tools, built workflows, and applied digital literacy skills.

-   **Explain your learning process**, sharing insights into how you approached assignments and developed key proficiencies.

-   **Defend your progress** using the Personal Learning Tracker, a shared document where you will assess your proficiency in relation to the course learning outcomes.

-   **Exercise evaluative judgment**, critically analyzing your strengths, areas for growth, and next steps in your digital learning journey.

These conversations are **formative**, meaning they are designed to support your learning and development. They may not result in a grade on your assignment, but you will receive valuable feedback that you can use to improve your standing in the course on your next assessment.

### How to Prepare for Your Assessment Conversation

-   **Use the Personal Learning Tracker:** This shared document between you and your instructor aligns course learning outcomes with proficiency indicators across assignments. It helps you track your progress, evaluate your learning, and practice evaluative judgment throughout the course. Keep it updated as you complete each assignment to prepare for the conversation.

-   **Prepare specific questions** about your work that you would like to discuss. Making a list ahead of time ensures we use our time efficiently.

-   **Review the course learning outcomes** and take notes on how you would explain your understanding of them. This is an opportunity for self-reflection and assessment.

-   **Review your work:** Assignments should demonstrate how you have met the targeted course learning outcomes.

-   **Reflect on your work:** Be prepared to show connections between concepts, apply them to your experiences or current events, and demonstrate personal reflection and critical thinking.

### Before the Assessment Conversation

-   Test your video and audio in Microsoft Teams to ensure everything is working correctly.

-   Practice sharing your screen in Teams, as well as sharing links in the chat. (See *Present content in Microsoft Teams meetings* in [MS Office 365 Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-content-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-fcc2bf59-aecd-4481-8f99-ce55dd836ce8){target="_blank"} for guidance.)

### During the Assessment Conversation

-   After a brief introduction, we will review your Personal Learning Tracker to discuss your progress and address any concerns.

-   I will ask you the guiding questions**,** such as:

    1.  *Overall, how are you feeling about the course and the content?*

    2.  *Are there any specific ways that I can better support your learning?*

    3.  *Do you need increased accountability?*

    4.  *How are you doing in meeting the goals that you set for yourself at the beginning of the course?*

-   Use your Personal Learning Tracker to explain how your assignments demonstrate progress toward proficiency. Highlight specific indicators of proficiency that you have met and areas where you continue to grow.

-   Clearly explain how your assignments provide evidence of your learning in relation to the course outcomes.

-   Your instructor will provide feedback to help you assess your progress, suggest improvements, and encourage further development.

-   Take notes on the feedback and reflect on how you can continue to grow in each of the learning outcome areas.

### Key Points to Highlight During Your Conversation

Avoid simply reading your assignments or reflections. Instead, focus on key learning moments:

-   What do you want your instructor to notice?

-   Which indicators of proficiency have been met?

-   What are you especially proud of?

-   How does your journal demonstrate evidence of learning?

By preparing thoughtfully and engaging in meaningful discussion, you will gain valuable insights into your learning progress and receive guidance to strengthen your digital literacy skills.
