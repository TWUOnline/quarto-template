    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to PSYC 106: Introduction to Psychology\nThis course will examine many different aspects of behaviour - from microscopic internal structures and functions to group and social processes. Though this journey covers many topics, the central theme of our exploration will be to understand why, and how, we behave the way we do. In Unit 1, we will start to explore how psychology can help you see the world in a different way and can help you understand why other people behave the way they do. One of the reasons psychology is such an exciting field is that it is easy to see how this field of study relates to your own life. You live out psychology; you feel emotions, you take in sensations, and you produce behaviours such as thoughts and actions. Additionally, human behaviour is complex and can be interpreted in numerous ways. Every topic in psychology could be examined from any one of these interdependent perspectives: biological, cognitive (thinking), and sociocultural (know as the biopsychosocial model). What is more is that for many people the spiritual perspective is an essential consideration, too. Therefore, to begin using psychology as a lens from which to understand behaviour it will be important for you to know what psychology is, what psychologists do, and how to critically evaluate your beliefs using the tools of psychological science.",

    "section": "1.1 What is Psychology",
    "text": "1.1 What is Psychology\nBefore you read the textbook, write a brief definition of psychology. (Or if you’ve already read the textbook try to remember how you would have defined psychology before you read it.) According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans, for example philosophy, or literature, or history? If you said, “Psychology is different because it uses the scientific method,” give yourself a pat on the back. Your textbook explains the scientific method.\nThe following simple parable from Philipchalk’s social psychology textbook illustrates three “helpful” approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment:\n\nOnce upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father’s field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man’s shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp.\n\nAlthough each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man’s problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994).\nI find psychology to be one of the most interesting areas of study for a number of reasons. First, because it is adventurous enough to study the complexities of people, and people like you and I are interesting. Second, I like the range of topics available to be studied in psychology - psychologists, as you will see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour; anything a human does can be studied in this discipline. Finally, prudent psychologists suspend their speculations and opinions as they look for evidence for their ideas. If they do not find sufficient evidence, they have the humility to change their ideas. When growing in knowledge about topics not yet entirely understood, humility is essential. Now, let us return to the scientific method and how psychology began.",

    "text": "1.2 How Did Psychology Begin?\nOne definition of psychology is that it is the application of the scientific method to the questions of philosophy. With that hint in mind, how far back do you think we could trace the roots of psychology? You will find answers to this question in the textbook, and also at sites such as the following:\n\nClassics in the History of Psychology\nPsychology (for a history of psychology in Canada)\n\nA more basic, tongue-in-cheek, answer to the question is the following: The first person interested in psychology was either the first person trying to understand the first person or the second person who was trying to figure out the first person!\n\n1.2.1 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to consider what you read in your exploration of the resources above – use the following questions to guide your reflection:\n\nWhat draws people to study psychology? (It is one of the most popular majors in North American universities).\nWhat drew you to study psychology?\nSome people argue that the scientific method is appropriate for studying inanimate objects and simple organisms but not appropriate for studying complex human behavior. What are the strengths and weaknesses of applying the scientific method to the study of people?\nSome postmodernists argue that since complete objectivity is impossible, science is not an appropriate route to the understanding of human thought and behavior.

    "section": "1.3 What Do Psychologists Do?",
    "text": "1.3 What Do Psychologists Do?\nAsk most people to name two or three famous psychologists and one of the first named will be Sigmund Freud. This reflects the common idea that most psychologists try to analyze people and figure out underlying motives so that they can help to solve deep-seated problems. In fact, less than half of all psychologists work in clinical settings studying the causes, diagnoses, and treatment of mental disorders. Many psychologists study human development, learning, memory and other mental processes. Others conduct research on groups and social influence. Some psychologists work in schools, others in government, and still others in industry. All of these psychologists are either trying to understand people better, or trying to help them, or both.\nFor simplicity, the different ways of approaching psychology can be grouped into three broad categories:\n\nThose that focus on the physical, biological bases of behavior.\nThose that concentrate on mental processes that control our actions.\nThose that emphasize the external environmental influences on what we think and do.\n\nWhich approach is best? The best approach is all of them. They all add something to our understanding of ourselves. It is best to see the many ways of studying human behavior as different perspectives rather than competing points of view. Like different perspectives on a landscape, they provide depth and dimensionality to our understanding. Why is Jenna blushing? From an external, environmental point of view we might say, “Because she just spilled her drink on herself.” From an internal, mental perspective we could respond,” Because she feels embarrassed.” Finally, from a biological perspective we could say, “Because her autonomic nervous system has signalled the blood vessels in her face to dilate.” Each explanation is correct, and each adds to our understanding of Jenna’s behavior. We might say that each explains Jenna’s behavior at a different level.\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Exploring Career Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resources below are intended to provide you with opportunity to explore the “What do Psychologists do?” question more deeply. The first of the following resources will help you to make the most of your undergraduate time in psychology and clarify some of the postgraduate educational and vocational options available to you. The second site discusses some of the kinds of topics towards which psychologists focus their research and practice. The goal of resources like these is to help you determine which direction you may most enjoy in the field of psychology.\n\nCareers in Psychology\nCanadian Psychological Association - Careers\n\nAfter exploring the different opportunities, consider the following questions:\n\nFor what careers would a psychology major be helpful?(The internet has information on this.)\nWhat are the steps necessary to become a psychologist in private clinical practice?\nWhat’s the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?\nWhich perspective or level of explanation do you personally find the most interesting? Why?\nWhy are some people wary of psychology?(A well-known televangelist once said, “You can’t be a Christian and a psychologist.”) What dangers do they see in studying psychology? Is there any justification for their fears?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class.",

    "section": "1.4 Thinking Critically with Psychological Science - Limits of Psychology",
    "text": "1.4 Thinking Critically with Psychological Science - Limits of Psychology\nIsn’t is just common sense?\nAs a behavioral science, psychology fits the description of all science attributed to Einstein—“nothing more than the refinement of everyday knowledge.” Psychology often refines what we already know, or at least suspected. For example, everyday knowledge tells us, “Opposites attract.” Psychology will tell us some of the conditions under which this is true and when it is not. But everyday knowledge also says, “Never too old to learn,” and “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” So which is it? Through careful study of relevant conditions, psychology can help us decide. (If you are interested in the folk wisdom of familiar sayings, and perhaps want to look for contradictory sayings, try Proverbs That Contradict Each Other)\nSometimes you may feel that psychologists’ discoveries are things you knew all along. In fact psychologists have studied this phenomenon too! They call it the hindsight bias. The hindsight bias is the feeling you get, after you learn something new, that you knew it all along (Hawkins & Hastie, 1990). However, I think that many of the things you will discover are somewhat surprising and unexpected, and you will enjoy this “refinement of everyday knowledge.”\nIsn’t it potentially dangerous?\nLike all knowledge, the value (or danger) of psychological knowledge is in how it is used. The following are potential misuses of psychological knowledge:\n\nAn understanding of some of the causes of behavior might lead to the inaccurate conclusion that all behavior could be explained and predicted if we had enough knowledge. We are robots, not free individuals.\nPsychological findings might be generalized beyond the situations in which they were found to be valid.\nKnowing some of the explanations for behavior takes away the mystery and wonder of human action.\nUnderstanding the causes of behavior can lead to the manipulation of people, perhaps even without their awareness.\nPsychological explanations leave no room for important religious beliefs.\n\n\n1.4.1 Activity: Ethics in Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of ethical questions do you think might arise in the study of psychology? Should there be limits to the use of animals to learn about basic mental or physical processes? What limits and guidelines would you suggest? What about research with humans? It is probably obvious that research should not inflict harm. But could even asking certain questions cause a certain amount of distress in some people? What about deception? Should it ever be used? If so, when and why? When does field research (the observation of people in natural settings) become an invasion of their privacy?\nYou can find a complete listing of ethical guidelines for research in psychology at:\n\nCanadian Psychology Association\nAmerican Psychology Association\n\nAfter reading about ethics in psychology, consider the following question:\n\nDo you think you would ever use deception in your research? If so, when would you use it?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Activity: Terminology Practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis is the title\n\n\n\nTake a moment to self-assess how well you know some of the concepts introduced in this unit.

    "section": "2.1 What is Intelligence?",
    "text": "2.1 What is Intelligence?\n\nIntelligence\nAs David Myers points out, intelligence is a slippery concept. We all have an idea of what it refers to, but we cannot agree on a single definition. Perhaps the most helpful advice is to remember, as Myers points out, that “intelligence is a socially constructed concept. Cultures deem ‘intelligent’ whatever attributes enable success in those cultures” (2010). Historically, in North American culture, the idea of intelligence performance on an IQ test. The composition of these tests reflected North American culture’s emphasis on particular mental abilities, specifically, those associated with success in an academic setting. More recently, we have come to realize that there are many kinds of intelligence. In this unit we will consider some varieties of intelligence, or multiple intelligences.\n\n\nTypes of Intelligence\n\nEmotional Intelligence\nI have to admit that when I first heard of emotional intelligence (EI) I was skeptical. It sounded like popular psychology - someone trying to make a buck preying on our need for self-knowledge. However, upon further investigation I found that EI was linked to social intelligence (the ability to understand and relate to people), a concept developed by the pioneering psychologist E.L. Thorndike in 1920. And upon still further investigation, I found EI made a lot of sense.\n\n\nSternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence\nRobert Sternberg wanted to show that intelligence was more than just one general ability (known as g theory). He believed our intelligence is best classified into three areas that predict real - world success: analytical, creative, and practical. The following article does a great job explaining the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence and its three sub-theories. It also makes note of the criticisms that have been brought against this theory. To better understand Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence follow the link below:\n\nThree Components of Intelligence\n\n\n\nHoward Gardner’s Nine Types of Intelligence\nHoward Gardner put together a robust, research-based theory of Multiple Intelligences. He put forth an understanding of intelligence promoting our abilities are best classified into nine independent intelligences, which include a broad range of skills beyond traditional school smarts. This illuminating read can help you understand what your primary intelligences are. Follow the link below:\n\nTheory of Multiple Intelligences\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Read and Learn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo add to your exploration of this topic, take a moment to read the following articles:\n\nEmotional Intelligence Consortium Website\nEQI Web Resource\n\nConsider how these articles connect to what you have learned in this section.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: Intelligence Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this section we examined Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature. Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial.\n\nEmotional Intelligence Test\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis section focused on Intelligence Testing. As we have seen, Intelligence Testing is best implemented after careful consideration.\nTake a moment to reflect on the following questions:\n\nHow do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illuminated by the test?\nIs ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?\nDo you believe E-IQ is more important than “intelligence” as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "text": "2.2 Extremes of Intelligence\n\nIQ Testing\nIn this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the “extremes.” Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person’s intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Articles of Interest\nTo supplement our understanding of this topic, take a moment to explore the following resources:\n\nThe Arc\nMENSA International\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Activity: IQ Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter considering the above, and having read the textbook’s discussion of intelligence testing, you might want to try some tests yourself.

Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?\n\n\nCould we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people?

    "text": "2.3 Nature-Nature and IQ\nWhile the debate rages over the relative contributions of nature and nurture to IQ, no one denies that heredity (nature) plays some role. The question arises then, “So what?” Are we going to try to control (and presumably increase) IQ through genetic engineering or some other method of eugenics (Eugenics is the search for hereditary factors that give people an evolutionary advantage; translated it can mean “good genes” or “good origin”)? Are we going to control who should have children and how many, allowing the most intelligent parents to have more children and restricting the less intelligent? When the genetic basis for IQ (or some other component of intelligence) is identified, will parents select embryos with greater potential? For more on this topic see the following quote and the website from which it came.\n\nIf we are concerned for the future of the (hopefully) millions of generations still to be born, we must realize that their fate lies to a considerable extent in the breeding practices of those who are currently alive. (Intelligence and Eugenics)\n\nWhat Will You Do?\nIf or when you have children, will you ban screens (TV, smart phone, tablet, laptop) as a “brain rotter” and read to them every day? Or will you just let nature take its course and allow both screens and reading?\nTest Biases?\nIQ tests are generally valid for their original purpose—as predictors of academic performance. Controversy arises when IQ scores are taken to mean overall intelligence and even overall worth. IQ scores consistently predict that some cultural and racial groups will do better at school than will other groups. These differences are an indication of bias not in the IQ tests but in the backgrounds and academic settings that first create and then magnify differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Articles of Interest\nTo supplement our understanding of this topic, take a moment to read through the following:\n\nThe Adoption History Project\nNature-Nature and IQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Activity: Ch. 9 Key Terms Quiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 9 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the following scenario (and questions):\n\nIf you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out\n\n\nWhat is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?\nIf IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class.",

Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer’s, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired.\nEmbryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It’s deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they’re genetically different.\nAt the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents.\nBottled Genes? One day parents may be able to pick any gene they desire from a range of bottled genes and have it put into their embryos. (quoted from “Designer Babies” website)\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Activity: Designer Babies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis activity involves some reading and reflection around the topic of genetic engineering.

    "section": "3.2 Infancy and Childhood",
    "text": "3.2 Infancy and Childhood\n\nA Child’s View of God\n\nOne evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the “mother,” Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother’s fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, “Does Jesus got a gun?” (Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 141)\n\nAs any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults—often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level.\n\n\nThe Process of Cognitive Change\nOur textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world.\nAlthough schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct.\nCan you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas?\nAlthough people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict.\nBasically, the process of cognitive change works as follows:\n\nPeople are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium.\nWhen a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict.\nEquilibrium may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation.\nAssimilation occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world.\nAccommodation occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema.\n\nThus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example:\nEquilibrium-Preexisting Schema: Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her.\nCognitive Conflict Produced: At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: “How can I like someone who is a different color?” To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options:\nOption A- Assimilation: In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: “Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.”\nOption B- Accommodation: The child’s preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, “Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.”\n\n\nCognitive Equilibrium is Restored\nAlthough cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Activity:Cognitive Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first three links below are articles that are intended to give you an opportunity to reflect on your own considerations around development. The last link is a test - along with the first three links, it is intended to provide some insights about your developmental trajectory in light of your crisis resolution, attachment style, and parenting styles:\n\nErik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development\nAttachment Issues in Children: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment\nSeven Tips for Stepfamily Success\nWhat is Your Parenting Style\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore moving on, take a moment to consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know….\nWould children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "text": "3.3 Adolescence\nJohn has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults’ “dominion” on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand “who he is” and “what his place is in the world”. John’s quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take.\nDoes any of the above sound familiar?\nBefore you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection:\n\nWhat physical changes did you experience in adolescence?\nHow did these physical changes make you feel?\nIn what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence?\nHow did your way of treating other people change during adolescence?\nWhat was most important to you during adolescence?\nTo what extent is “who you are today” a function of “who you became during adolescence”?\n\n\nNo Adolescence?\nIn other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period?\n\n\nIdentity\nThe concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of “who we are” in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity—even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents.\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this section we explore adolescence and the changes in development we go through. Below are some resources that help to help support your understanding - consider how they connect to the content examined above:\n\nJournal of Adolescence\nErik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development\nConnecting Parents, Teens, & Jesus in a Disconnected World\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Activity: Chapter 10 Terminology Practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 10 in your textbook, practice using the activity below. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Activity: Question for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider what you have learned in this section and take a moment to reflect on the following question:\n\nWould you want to live your adolescence over again if you could? Why or why not?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class.",

    "section": "4.1 Adulthood",
    "text": "4.1 Adulthood\n\nPsychosocial Development\nThere are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts:\n\nEarly Adulthood\nMiddle Adulthood\nLate Adulthood\n\nIn Early Adulthood (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important—like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one’s children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation.\nIn Middle Adulthood (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways—coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation.\nIn Late Adulthood (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life.\n\n\nGuilt\nOne of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146)\nThe textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God.\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis activity involves some reading and reflection around Erikson’s Eight Psychosocial Stages and an article from Harvard University illuminating the importance of relationships in healthy aging.\n\nErik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development\nGood Genes are Nice, but Joy is Better\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake some time to consider what you have learned in this section. Think about the following questions:\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish during your “adult development” years?\n\n(If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?)\n\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "section": "4.2 Death and Dying",
    "text": "4.2 Death and Dying\n\nDeath\nSecular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying?\nAs medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more “natural death?” What is “natural death?” How far does one go in “allowing” natural death? (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146)\n\n\nHospice\n\nYou matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die. (Dame Cicely Saunders)\n\nDuring the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name.

    "text": "5.1 Psychoanalytic View\n“We are sent into this world to acquire a personality and a character to take with us that can never be taken from us.” (In a letter from a WW II Royal Air Force pilot to his mother)\n\nPersonality Theories\nIn this chapter we consider the topic of personality theories. In doing this we examine several major perspectives. Within each of these there are many variations (e.g., Adler, Jung, and Freud within the psychoanalytic perspective). If you would like to know more about this area, you might be interested in taking the course “Theories of Personality” (Psychology 301 at TWU).\nAside from all these more formal theories, each of us has an implicit personality theory. This is our personal idea of what people are like, including which personality characteristics go together. For example, we think of people who are attractive and intelligent as likable rather than unlikable. Our socialization leads us to assume certain traits go together. As you go through this chapter, you may find some approaches are closer to your own assumptions (implicit theory), and you may prefer these approaches to others. You may also find your implicit theory becomes more explicit. Finally, you may even modify your own theory in the face of new information.\n\n\nDreams\n“And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel 2:28).\nGod apparently spoke through dreams many times in the bible, and in Joel 2:28 He promised to do so in the future. Does God still (or again) speak through dreams? Are we missing out on a possible leading from God when we ignore our dreams? If you would like to read more on this subject you might be interested in books by Christians on this subject. For example, see John A. Sanford’s Dreams, God’s Forgotten Language, or Morton T. Kelsey’s God, Dreams, and Revelation, or Abraham Schmitt’s Before I Wake. The website below (cf. Online Resources) contains some balanced advice. Also, voice your opinion or give your experience in the online discussion.\n\n\nBirth Order\nYou may be familiar with Adler’s concept of the family constellation, which implies that position in the family has a powerful effect on goals, self-concept, and ways of relating to others.\nAs a test of this concept, think of a three-child family, all of whom were born within a few years (using larger families makes things too complicated). Try applying Adler’s theory to predict which child in the family is likely to be:\n\nthe best student\nthe most shy\nthe most helpful around the house\nthe most outgoing\nthe “hell raiser”\nthe most “helpless”\nthe charmer\nthe “baby” of the family\n\nYou will not always be right—but neither was Adler. The important thing is to note that Adler made psychology aware of the different expectations and social influences on different children in the same family. In some respects, children in the same position in different families are more alike than are children in differ­ent positions in the same family\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHaving just introduced Personality Theories to the course, we begin to explore psychoanalytic views of human development. Dreams and birth order are but two of the constructs that help shape and reflect who we are as individuals- there are many different theories and interpretations on the role dreams and birth order play. Take a moment to consider the following articles:\n\nChristian Perspective on Dreams\nBirth Order and Your Personality\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a moment to reflect on what you have learned in this section. Use the following questions to guide your self-reflection:\n\nDoes God speak through dreams?\nWhat reasons do you have for your opinion? Can you give an example?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class.",

    "text": "5.2 Humanistic View\n\nSelf-Esteem\nIn 1890, William James gave a simple formula for self-esteem:\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames explained:\n\nSuch a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator. To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where disappointment is incessant and the struggle unending, this is what men will always do. . . . How pleasant is the day we give up striving to be young—or slenderThank Godwe say, those illusions are gone. (James, 1890) (Quoted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk)\n\n\n\nSelf-Esteem: A Contrary View\nSelf-esteem is a popular topic in North American society and researchers have expended a vast amount of effort studying it. Approximately 10,000 studies have explored the possible relationship between self-esteem and various human problems (Scheff et al., 1989). The assumption that low self-esteem is at the root of many personal and social problems has reached the level of a cultural truism. The California legislature (1990) has even established a task force to promote self-esteem, believing that enhanced self-esteem is a vaccine against drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other social ills. Sharon Neuman (1992) suggests that the need to enhance self-esteem has become a “motherhood issue”—meaning that belief in its value is so widely accepted it goes unquestioned.\nRecently, however, several authors have begun to challenge this focus on raising self-esteem. They point out that high self-esteem can sometimes be detrimental, if, for example, it leads people to set inappropriate, risky goals that are beyond their capabilities (Baumeister, et al., 1993a). In addition, the relationship between self-esteem and other measures of well-being is often weak or nonexistent (Burr & Christensen, 1992; Hermans, 1992; Jackson, 1984). Perhaps most importantly, high self-esteem may be the result and not the cause of other positive tendencies (Alexander & Baker, 1992).\nSharon Neuman (1992) argues that self-esteem must follow, not precede, real achievement. She claims that no number of self-esteem programs can replace the genuine satisfaction of a job well done. Wesley Burr and Clark Christensen (1992) suggest that the idea that we must esteem ourselves highly before we can value and love others is a “Western myth.” They add:\nWe would improve our thinking if we were to take the idea that “we cannot love others until we love ourself” and turn it 180 degrees to be: “We cannot love ourself until we love others.” We would further improve our thinking if we then concluded that this is a fairly irrelevant and unimportant idea anyway because it still implies that loving ourself is what is important. (p. 464)\nBurr and Christensen suggest that self-esteem is a fruit and not a root of healthy emotional connections between people. (From Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk)",

    "text": "5.3 Christianity & Humanism\nSome Christians object to the humanistic perspective because of its unqualified affirmation of human goodness and its apparent promotion of self-love. It is important to note, however, that humanistic psychology is not to be equated with the philosophy and social movement called humanism. Although it focuses on humans, so too do other approaches to personality. (The behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner was a signatory to the Humanist Manifesto but a major opponent of humanistic psychology.) In his authoritative work on the history of psychology, Ernest Hilgard writes, “Humanistic psychology as something contemporary is not to be confused with other forms of humanism, such as humanistic studies which refer to classical or liberal arts topics, or that form of humanism which sets itself against theological beliefs (1987, p. 504). In fact, J.I. Packer and Thomas Howard in their book Christianity: The true humanism (1985) argue that only Christianity gives a valid basis for assuming humans have value.\n\n\n5.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs we explore a humanistic view, as it relates to personality, we start to see the development of self-esteem.

    "section": "5.4 Trait View",
    "text": "5.4 Trait View\n\nTrait Theory\nIn the previous lesson we discussed implicit theories of personality. Many people’s implicit theories include elements of trait theory. They believe that personality is made up of traits. For example, popular ideas of leadership and success often rest on this assumption (e.g., Traits for success).\nActually this view is quite old, going back to the ancient Greeks:\n\nAlmost 2,000 years ago a Greek physician named Galen suggested that there were four basic types of personality, based on four different “humors,” or fluids, in the body. Galen called these personality types sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. When Eysenck combined his two basic personality scales, he found that he had a “less humorous” version of a classic theory. (from Understanding Human Behavior by Ron Philipchalk & James McConnell)\n\nIn psychology today there is a growing effort towards accurate measurement of personality traits, and investigation of the ways in which traits interact with the environment.\nOne of the most popular applications of trait theory is in the prediction of employee success. After looking at the “Big 5,” which trait do you think is the most important? Imagine you own a business and you have to make a quick decision to hire one of 5 very similar applicants. The only trait measure you have is each applicant’s score on the “Big 5.” The only problem is that each one scores high on a different factor. Which one would you hire?\n\n\nMeasuring Personality\nThe trait approach to personality is closely linked to the matter of psychological testing. The strength of this approach is that it provides quantifiable data for analysis and comparison. The weakness is the difficulty in measuring traits accurately. Remember our discussion of standardization, validity, and reliability of intelligence tests? Personality tests must also meet the same criteria. (An additional problem is that our situations guide us as well as our traits.) This is an important point to remember when you encounter the many so-called personality tests in the popular media.\n\n\nBarnum Effect\nDo you have a desire to know what “kind” of person you are? This common desire can be used to manipulate you in a variety of ways. As discussed in the textbook, sometimes it is easier to make people believe that you are measuring their personality than it is to actually measure it. In fact, it is remarkably easy for people to be convinced that a personality profile describes them well. This phenomena is known as “the Barnum effect,” after the circus showman P. T. Barnum. The Barnum effect hearkens back to the late 1940s, when psychologist Bertram Forer gave research participants a personality test and then generated a personality description that subjects believed was based on their test responses. Even though all participants were given exactly the same personality description, they found the profile to be highly convincing and descriptive of them as an individual. When asked to rate how well the profile described them, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), the average rating was an impressive 4.26 (Forer, 1949)You, too, can try this experiment. Read the personality description below and rate, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), how well this description describes you:\nYou have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to ad­mire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused energy which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. Dis­ci­plined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and in­se­cure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed-in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as being an independent thinker and do not accept other opinions without satisfactory proof. You have found it un­wise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extro­verted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Activity: Practice, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this topic we have continued to develop our understanding of personality. Below are some tests you can take - consider the results and reflect on how useful these types of resources are in assessing personality:\n\nQueendom.com\n\nQueendom.com is a great resource for different kinds of tests. You will be looking specifically at Personality tests on this site. When you go to www.queendom.com, click on the “TESTS, QUIZZES & POLLS” tab and select TESTS. From the PERSONALITY TESTS list select ONE of the following personality tests:\n\nDISC Personality Test\nBig Five Personality Test\nSelf-Control & Self-Monitoring Test\nHappiness Test\nLocus Of Control & Attributional Style Test\n\nInteract with the results and ponder whether or not you think the test is accurate or inaccurate and whether or not the information provided seems unique to you or could it be applied to anyone given the right situation.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Activity: Question for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a moment to reflect on the following question - consider how they connect to what you have learned in this section:\n\nWhat is the role of heredity in personality?\nIs our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified?\n\nAuthor Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts.\n\nDoes the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits?\nWhat is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? - Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "section": "5.5 Social-Cognitive View",
    "text": "5.5 Social-Cognitive View\n\nYou + Your Environment\nSocial-Cognitive Theory (SCT) was originally formulated by Albert Bandura at Stanford University. The fundamental premise of SCT is that models serve as the basis for learning new behaviours and that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic and reciprocal interaction of the person, environment, and behavior; this is known as reciprocal determinism. Its emphasis is on external and internal social reinforcement and how these factors shape and maintain behavior in different environments. The theory also recognizes the influence of a person’s past experiences, which factor into whether behavioral action will occur. These past experiences serve as the primary reinforcements and expectancies, shaping whether or not a person will engage in a specific behavior and answering why a person engages in that behaviour.\nIn summary, the Social-Cognitive view recognizes the mutual interdependence (“reciprocal determinism”) of individual qualities and situations. While we do have individual patterns of behaviour, we exhibit these according to the way we perceive our situation.\n\n\n\n5.5.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWho we are is, in large part, shaped by the environment in which live. Take a moment to consider the following resources and how they relate to this concept:\n\nLearned Helplessness\nLearned Optimism\n\nThe above resources will help you to think about how your environment can impact your sense of agency (the ability to choose your behaviours to impact the environment) and how your sense of agency can influence your environment. This demonstrates the key idea of Social-Cognitive Theory, that you are in a constant, dynamic relationship with your environment and each factor is shaped by the other.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Activity: Chapter 12 Key Terms Quiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 12 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz.

    "text": "6.1 Attributes and Actions\n\nThe Ultimate Attribution Error\nIf you study attribution further, perhaps in a “Social Psychology” course, you find that there are several errors in attribution common to our perceptions of behavior. The ultimate attribution error is a combination of biases that influences our interpretation of behavior in our friends and our foes. The ultimate attribution error is our tendency to use internal attributions to explain socially desirable actions by members of our own group and socially undesirable actions by members of an opposing group. The same bias leads us to use external attributions to explain socially undesirable actions of our own group and socially desirable actions of our foes (Hewstone, 1988; Pettigrew, 1979, 1980 ; Taylor and Jaggi, 1974 ).\nA study by Donald Taylor and V. Jaggi (1974) illustrates this bias among south Indian subjects. Taylor and Jaggi found that Hindu subjects attributed socially desirable actions to the good character of Hindus, but attributed the same actions in Muslims to environmental circumstances. In addition, Hindu subjects blamed socially undesirable actions on Hindus’ circumstances and Muslims’ character. We commit the ultimate attribution error when we say, “Our soldiers fight because they have to” (external attribution), but “Our enemies fight because they are warlike” (internal attribution). And, “Our soldiers are naturally brave”; “Our enemies are forced to do daring deeds.”\nThe ultimate attribution error tends to perpetuate our false stereotypes and prejudices. Our biased interpretations have a plausible ring because the reasons for our enemies’ actions are usually somewhat ambiguous and open to various interpretations. In addition, our friends fall into the same error and support our views. Consequently, we continue to see behavior the way we expect or would like it to be, and people we don’t like never get a chance to prove us wrong. (from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\nActions and Attitudes\n“You can’t legislate morality” is a commonsense chestnut that social psycholo­gists have found not to be true. Attitudes do follow behavior. Eliot Aronson makes a persuasive argument that racial prejudiced attitudes and behaviors in the have actually responded dramatically and positively to civil rights legisla­tion and to court actions in the last several decades. In addition, he discusses sev­eral other methods that have been successfully used to reduce prejudice and discrimination, including his “jigsaw” technique, designed for use with grade school children. Aronson, E. (1992). The social animal (6th ed.). New York: W. H. Freeman.\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAttributes, and our perception of attributes, has been the focus of this lesson. Take a moment to read through the following resources and consider how they connect to what you have learned:\n\nAttribution Theory\nCognitive Dissnonance\n\nThese articles bring to light phenomena that tend to occur automatically (without conscious processing) for most people. Now that the concepts of attribution and cognitive dissonance are in your awareness it could be valuable to thoughtfully consider which attribution style you tend towards (dispositional or situational) and how that style influences how you treat others and how others respond to you. And, then ask, what am I doing with my cognitive dissonance? Do I tend to change my attitudes to fit my behaviours or do I adjust my behaviours to be alignment with my attitudes, values, and beliefs?\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions:\n\nDescribe a time when you were forced to act in a certain way, and then later found you had come to enjoy what you were doing. That is, your attitude followed your actions.\nCould this happen with religious attitudes and beliefs too?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "text": "6.2 Conformity\n“Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority.” (from Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, p. 97)\n\nConformity vs. Compliance & Obedience\nIn this lesson, and the next two, we will be looking at social influence. Because this is a large and interesting topic we will discuss three types of social influence separately: conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity, our topic for today, refers to going along with other people without anyone explicitly asking you to. Compliance refers to going along with the request of another person when you have a choice not to. Being influenced by a salesperson to buy something is an example of compliance. Obedience refers to going along with an order when no choice is offered, as in the army.\n\n\nNorms\nGroup expectations or norms exert a powerful influence on our behavior. We generally go along with what people expect of us not because we have to but because resistance is so uncomfortable. You can experience the power of group norms in controlling your behavior if you attempt to violate a norm for acceptable behavior (e.g., go the front of a line and edge in; ask someone for their seat on a bus or subway; sit close to a stranger in a public place when other seats are available).\n\n\nUsing Conformity\nAt the lowest level of social influence people are observed to go along with what other people are doing, often without being asked. Adults are frequently critical of adolescents for conforming to erratic youthful fashions, while they are often just as bound to their own conservative guidelines (why else would anyone where a necktie?). Conformity is a common and usually harmless part of everyday life; yet it can lead to complacent and even erroneous judgments. In a classic study of conformity approximately one-third of the subjects gave what they knew to be the wrong answer when four other “subjects” (actually confederates of the experimenter) gave the same wrong answer (Asch, 1952, 1955). Although frequently innocuous, conformity can be harmful when it is inappropriate.\nAre Christians abusing the power of conformity when they pre- arrange for volunteers to “go forward” at an altar call in order to increase the number of non-Christians who will respond? Or are they merely being sensitive to the pressures that the non-Christian feels to conform to those who remain in their seats? Should Christians use this technique of influence? (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p212)\n\n\nConformity & Culture\nResearcher Gary Lee and his associates found significant differences among 122 cultures in the emphasis given to conformity. Conformity differences de­velop as a result of socialization of children into parental values. Parents in cul­tures emphasizing conformity relied more heavily on physical punishment than parents in cultures emphasizing self-reliance.\n\n\nMach Test\nThe “Mach Test” is a twenty-item inventory designed to reveal Machiavellian tenden­cies, a manipulative kind of social skill. Based on Machiavelli’s writings, the in­stru­ment purports to identify people who, under social pressure, are able to retain their composure, while others are losing control. You can get an idea of your mach score, and thus presumably your tendency to use and be influenced by social influence, at:\n\nMach Test\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe investigated conformity, and the role it plays. The following resources will help support your understanding:\n\nIntroduction to Social Influence\nConformity AND Obedience\n\nDue to the pervasiveness of social influence, it cannot be overstated how important it is to understand the concepts and techniques associated with it. The purpose of these resources is to allow you to grow in your ability to be persuasive and to recognize when tools of influence are being used on you. It will also allow you to be more mindful of what/who you are conforming to and why it is that you are doing so. If you are really adventurous you may even want to take this knowledge to help you or someone else adopt a new attitude, belief, or action.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity: Questions for Consideraton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a moment to consider the following questions in light of what you have learned in this section:\n\nWhat pressures for conformity exist in your community? On your campus?\nWhat happens to people who do not conform?\nIs conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "section": "6.3 Obedience",
    "text": "6.3 Obedience\nObedience refers to the strongest level of social influence, the level at which an order is given and no choice is assumed. For example, we are expected to obey the law; we are not assumed to have a choice.\nThe study of obedience has proven somewhat unsettling for those with an optimistic view of human nature. Under orders, people have been willing to (a) subdue a helpless protesting individual with electric shock labeled extremely dangerous (Milgram, 1963); (b) administer a drug to a patient at double the recommended dosage, when the drug had not been approved by the hospital and when, contrary to regulations, the orders were given by an unfamiliar physician over the phone (Hofling et al., 1966), (c) place cute puppies in a restraining harness and give them strong electric shock (Sheridan and King, 1972). However, rather than uncovering a sadistic or evil type of individual these studies indicate that in the momentum of the situation, and under legitimate authority, people will perform acts which they would otherwise find abhorrent.\nThe ominous parallel with so-called “war crimes” is clear. Soldiers from many countries and in various wars have committed heinous acts of cruelty and slaughter against innocent men, women, and children. Yet they were not particularly evil or sadistic men; they were simply following orders. The research on obedience raises the chilling possibility that anyone of us would do the same thing in the same situation.\nThe potentially destructive power of religious authority was clearly demonstrated in 1978. In Jonestown, Guyana, more than 900 followers of religious-cult leader Jim Jones obeyed his orders and committed suicide by drinking poison. Christian leaders need to beware of the awesome power of their position, particularly when they claim to speak as the voice of God. (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 214-215)\n\nAvoiding Destructive Obedience\nHow can you protect yourself from participating in destructive obedience? Actually, you may have already taken the first step. Growing evidence suggests that when people learn about research findings such as these, they tend to change their behavior to take this knowledge into account (Sherman, 1980). There are, however, several more active steps you can take to reduce your vulnerability to malevolent authority.\nFirst, you can question the legitimacy of the authority. Ask yourself if the person giving the orders really has the right to command you to do what he or she is asking. Special uniforms, insignias, and titles can create an aura of authority even where none exists. For example, Brad Bushman found that 72 % of pedestrians gave change to a young man when ordered to by a woman in uniform, compared to 48 % when the woman was dressed in business clothes. Bushman found that the nature of the uniform did not even have to be related to the order being given (Bushman, 1984, 1988).\nSecond, ask yourself if your obedience might cause harm to someone else. Remember that even if you act under legitimate authority you are still responsible for any harm you produce.\nThird, talk to others about your misgivings. This can not only strengthen your personal resolve, but it may also convince others to join you as well. In one field experiment, 21 out of 22 nurses were prepared to obey an unfamiliar physician whose order violated hospital policy and possibly endangered the patients. The nurses had no chance to consult with anyone else (Hofling et al., 1966). In a second study, however, when the nurses were given the opportunity to contact their supervisors and other nurses, only 2 out of 18 were willing to obey (Rank & Jacobson, 1977).\nMilgram also demonstrated the effect of support for disobedience. In one experiment he employed two additional confederates. They posed as co-teachers who, along with the real subject, gave shocks to the “learner.” One confederate refused to continue at 150 volts, the other confederate broke off at 210 volts. With this type of additional support, 90 % of the subjects refused to go all the way to the maximum shock—total obedience was reduced to 10 % (Milgram, 1974).\nFinally, if you decide to defy authority, you might take a lesson from the conformity research and remember the power of calm, reasonable dissent. One of the most famous literary examples of defiance, Herman Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, illustrates this “gentle rebellion:”\n\n“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk), and see if there is anything for me.”\n“I would prefer not to.”\n“You will not?”\n“I prefer not.”\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?\n“Bartleby” - No answer\n“Bartleby,” in a louder tone. - No answer.\n“Bartleby,” I roared.\nLike a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\n“Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.”\n“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.\nBartleby manages to defy his employer and yet keep his job because his meek reply is so disarming. At times a more aggressive stance may be necessary, but remember, resistance is always possible. Obedience should not be blind. (from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis unit, we learned about obedience. We saw that obedience is strongest level of social influence. Read through the following resources and consider how they relate to what you have learned:\n\nMilgram experiment facts for kids\nCanadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists\nEthical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to read each resource thoroughly. What is important is to gain comprehension of the importance of using ethical guidelines when doing research on conformity, compliance, and obedience. Start to ponder how necessary is it to involve the use of deception in research. Ask yourself how you would feel if you were actually part of an experiment that was measuring compliance and you were deceived about what the researchers were actually doing? Also, while reading this information have you been able to recognize areas of your life where you are unquestionably following an authority figure? When answering questions like this I would encourage you to not be overly critical of yourself or others, rather, just notice where certain phenomena are present in your life and if you would like to do anything about it.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRead through the following and consider the questions below:\n\nWhen people read about Stanley Milgram’s experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject’s welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram’s results?\n\n\nDoes the severity of the problem studied—in this case destructive obedience—justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects?\nUnder what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "text": "6.4 Compliance\n\nThis fictitious letter, based upon actual appeals I have received, contains several examples of techniques of persuasion. Without criticizing the writer’s motives, a social psychologist could identify examples of card stacking, plain folks, foot-in-the-door, and other effective procedures of persuasion that we will discuss below.\nCompliance refers to an intermediate level of influence. Here we have the familiar situation where a request is made of us, but it is assumed that we have a choice; we don’t have to comply with the persuasive communication. In the letter we see the use of several techniques which have been found to increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication:\n\nCard Stacking is the selection of only those examples which support the proponent’s argument (Mr. Smith’s example is presented as if it were typical).\nThe Band Wagon Effect gives the impression that many other people are involved, and that everyone is doing it (“thousands of others are standing with you”).\nA Testimonial is a personal example of the successful application of the proponent’s argument (Mr. Smith provides a concrete example of what might be expected).\nPlain Folks refers to the association of the person or product with simple ordinary people (“this poor country boy”).\nThe foot-in-the-door technique is the attempt to get you to comply in a small way, knowing that this greatly increases your chance of complying to a larger request (in our example reading the letter, using the “prayer square,” or sending a very small donation are small requests which could be followed up with requests for larger gifts).\nName Calling is a technique which persuades people to reject something which they may know nothing about (“the forces of evil”).\nTransfer is the association of a person or product with something that people already feel strongly about (“God,” “family,” “children”).\n\nThese and other techniques have been shown to greatly increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication. They are often quite apparent in appeals by religious leaders for financial support. Should Christians use these techniques of influence? (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 211, 213)\n\n\n6.4.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this Topic we studied compliance and its use as a tool of influence. Take a moment to read through the following resources to further your understanding:\n\nSocial Media and Its Stark Influence on Society \nCults: Questions and Answers\n\nThe purpose of the information being shared in this topic and through these resources is to help you recognize who and/or what you are allowing to be an influence in your life? Asking the question, “Who is teaching me how to be influential and what direction is that influence taking me in?” can be invaluable in helping you examine how you are spending your time and if you are truly satisfied in the direction of your life. Remember, tools of influence are just that – tools. Any tool can be used towards benefit or detriment, it just depends on how it is being applied.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a moment to reflect on what you have learned this week. Use the following questions to guide your reflection:\n\nHave you ever been taught a sales technique in your job experience? If so, explain…\n\nIf you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one:\n\nOne of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line.\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

No single factor has more impact on shaping the quality and direction of your life over virtually every aspect of your existence than relationships. In a way, everyone is a social psychologist. People constantly form ideas/opinions about why a person or a group of people are acting the way they are. Social psychology is similar to what people find themselves naturally doing except it uses scientific tools to study these hypotheses (the ideas/opinions). Social psychologist are primarily interested in examining the different ways that individual’s effect groups of people and the way groups of people effect individual’s. In this unit you will be introduced to some historical studies and main concepts in this field. Topics covered in this chapter include social influences on behaviour, social impressions and judgements, the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, and effective communication. In Unit 6 (Part 1) you looked at attributes and actions, conformity, obedience, and compliance.\nPlease note that this unit will also examine prejudice and aggression. Although these topics are not specifically covered in the textbook, they are important to social psychology, attraction, and altruism.",

    "section": "7.1 Prejudice and Aggression",
    "text": "7.1 Prejudice and Aggression\n\nPrejudice & Religion\nSome of the first research to study the effects of religion (Christianity) investigated its role in prejudice. The consistent finding of this line of study was that the more religious people were, the more prejudiced they were likely to be Allport and Kramer (1946). Because racial prejudice is so clearly contrary to religious teaching, Gordon Allport called this Religion’s Grand Paradox. In the area of racial prejudice in North America, Christianity did not appear to improve behavior.\nReligion’s Grand Paradox was gradually resolved as researchers refined their definition of religious. When the apparently prejudiced church attenders were divided into those for whom religion served a social function and was a means to an end (extrinsic religious orientation) and those for whom religion was an integral part of their lives and an end in itself (intrinsic religious orientation), it was the extrinsics who had raised the prejudice scores of the entire group. The intrinsics were found to be even less prejudiced than the non-attenders. Apparently an intrinsic religious orientation has a beneficial effect on behavior, at least on racial prejudice (Allport, 1959).\n\n\nSports as Catharsis?\nThe idea that relieving emotional tension causes a purging of pent-up energy is called the catharsis hypothesis. According to Aristotle—who first proposed the concept of catharsis—even viewing powerful emotional events can be cathartic. Thus we should be able to reduce our aggressive tendencies by watching others act out their aggression, as well as by acting aggressively ourselves.\nResearch, however, does not lend much support to this common-sense idea. For example, Robert Arms and his associates report that hockey, football, and wrestling fans exhibit more aggression after viewing the event than before (Arms et al., 1979; Goldstein & Arms, 1971; Russell, 1983) (see Figure 11.1). Arthur Patterson (1974) found that high school football players were more aggressive after the season than before it. And Dane Archer and Rosemary Gartner report that a nation’s murder rate tends to jump after a war is over (Archer & Gartner, 1976).\n\n\nCompensatory Machoism\nMarshall Segall and his colleagues point out that cultures typically expect men to be macho —that is, to behave in ways that indicate their strength, virility, and willingness to confront an adversary. But Segall and his colleagues suggest that biological mechanisms interact with complex cultural processes to produce a kind of “compensatory machoism.” Very briefly, the elements in this process are these:\n\nAll societies have some division of labor by sex, resulting in sex-linked roles. For example, females do most of the child rearing in most societies and virtually all of it in some. Boys have less opportunity than girls to learn their roles by modeling because they are raised by women and have comparatively little contact with adult males.\nFor various historical and environmental reasons, fathers in some societies are more likely to be absent. Paradoxically, in these societies young males are expected to develop a particularly distinct male identity. These young males are driven—consciously or unconsciously—to display “manly” behavior and avoid appearing “womanly” at all costs.\nSome societies recognize this need and provide initiation ceremonies that serve to “stamp in” masculinity for boys who need it because of inadequate opportunity to acquire it in childhood. These ceremonies affirm the young male’s adult masculinity.\nAdolescent males in societies without initiation ceremonies may exaggerate their biological tendencies toward aggression in an attempt to assert their own masculinity.\n\nSegall and his associates explain, “We suggest that in societies that have the preconditions requiring a stamping-in of masculinity, but which don’t achieve this through initiation ceremonies or other institutionalized practices, adolescent males will try on their own to assert their masculinity” (p. 281). The Segall group calls the resultant aggression compensatory machoism. Compensatory machoism is the display of behavior intended to identify oneself with the cultural image of masculinity. The resulting aggression is rooted not in anger but in a “felt need to escape from womanliness and to mark one’s masculine gender” (p. 281).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of a cultural group in North America that seems to illustrate this process particularly well?\n\n\n\nMarshall Segall and his colleagues suggest that many young black American males illustrate this process. Social conditions (unemployment, educational deficits, racial discrimination) contribute to a prevalence of broken homes with female-headed households. Young men in these conditions attempt to assert their masculine identity through compensatory machoism. They are tough, independent, and violently aggressive. As a result, murder is their leading cause of death. A black man in stands a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered in his lifetime, compared with 1 in 131 for white men and 1 in 369 for white women. The Segall group quotes one young black male who says that in urban ghettos “You must walk angry, talk angry, think angry . . . . You’re either a chump or a champ . . . . You’re macho or gay.” (adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\nEmpathy & Aggression\nSeveral researchers suggest that empathy and concern for others may be important tools for reducing aggression. Prejudice, discrimination, and violent sexual aggression flourish when we dehumanize a victim. Empathy reverses this process by making us identify with a potential victim. For example, Ken-Ichi Ohbuchi and his colleagues found that Japanese students gave less shock to a “victim” if the victim first aroused subjects’ empathy by disclosing information about herself or by expressing her fear of shock. (adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\nConflict Resolution & Culture\nFumie Kumagai and Murray Straus report significant differences in the way con­flicts are resolved between marital partners in different cultures. Using the “Conflict Tactics Scale,” these researchers asked high school seniors in, and the United States how their parents settled disputes. Violent means of “resolution” were most common in American couples, followed by Japanese, and then Indian couples.\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following articles are intended to deepen your understanding of discrimination, racism, hate and violence. Hopefully this information will cause you to consider how you’ve been informed about these topics. Additionally, it may be valuable, in light of the research, to consider how much hate and violence you have exposure to through gaming and TV and how this is impacting your attitude and behaviour towards other people.

Use the following questions to guide your reflection:\n\nIf removing parts of the brain reliably reduced aggression, do you think violent criminals should be forced to have this operation?\nShould violent content be removed from video games, movies, and TV (why or why not)?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "section": "7.2 Attraction & Altruism",
    "text": "7.2 Attraction & Altruism\nWhy do I like you? Let me count the ways:\n\nWe often like people for whom we have suffered.\nWe like people more after we have done small favours for them.\nWe like people best whose (accidentally over­heard) descriptions of us begin on a negative note and end with a posi­tive tone.\nWe like people who convert to our point of view better than we like people who have agreed with us all along.\nWe like highly competent people better after they have committed a blunder.\n\n\nCulture & Attraction\nThe characteristics that are attractive in the opposite sex, as well as the impor­tance of physical attractiveness, are different in different cultures. Deborah Stiles and her colleagues found that Mexican adolescents valued liking children, helping others, high intelligence, and inner goodness and honesty in their oppo­site-sex ideal. American adolescents gave higher ratings to having a lot of money, being fun, popular, good looking, and sexy. Karen Dion and her colleagues found that physical attractiveness is more impor­tant in a culture where individualism (Canadian) rather than collectivism (Chinese) is valued.\nDavid Buss and 49 collaborators in 33 countries asked young men and women (average age 23 years) about the attributes they looked for in potential mates. The researchers found many differences among cultures. The most pervasive difference they found was the emphasis given to “traditional” versus “modern” attributes.\nAmerican young people differed from the international average by placing a higher value on a college degree, earning capacity, heredity, and “an exciting personality.” They placed a relatively low value on housekeeping skills, and intelligence (Buss, 1990). Without this kind of information it would be easy for us to assume that people in other cultures look for the same qualities in their potential mates as we do. (adapted from Understanding Human Behavior by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\nCulture & Altruism\nBenjamin Colby reports that differences in altruism between stu­dents from 133 different cultures were predictive of their ability to adapt to university culture (altruistic students adapted better). In one study Wegner and Crano found that racial fac­tors affected helping behavior. An exper­i­menter who was apparently engrossed in examining a deck of 500 computer cards approached naive subjects. Approximately one step away from the subject, the experimenter “accidentally” dropped the entire deck. African Americans helped Caucasians 17 percent of the time but they helped African Americans 75 percent of the time. Caucasians helped both Caucasians and African Americans 44 percent of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nCross-cultural research seems particularly relevant to the topic of helping in that Jesus point in the parable of the “Good Samaritan” was that cultural enemies, Jews and Samaritans, should love and help each other\n\n\n\n\n\nAltruism & Religion\nThe study of altruism or helping behavior also yields some interesting results with regard to the effects of religion. Research has consistently found that only a minority of people will stop to help someone who is clearly in need, especially if they are in a hurry themselves. Darley and Batson (1973) found that this was true even for seminary students, and even when they were on their way to give a talk on the Good Samaritan. Furthermore, they found that the most “religiously devout” were the least sensitive to the victims needs; when they did offer help, they often forced it on the victim even when he or she insisted on being left alone. Batson and Gray (1981) also found that the religiously devout tended to offer help when it was not wanted. Apparently if religion makes a difference it is not always good.\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that although only a minority of the seminarians stopped to help, they were all on their way to help the experimenter by giving a talk. Thus it was not a matter of helping or not, but a choice between which to help. If they stopped, they were led to believe, they would be late, and might endanger their ability to be of help to the experimenter.\nIn another setting, Perry London (1970) found Christian teaching often played a role in the justification given by those who helped hide Jews from the Nazis during World War II. Further research is needed before the role of religiousness in helping behavior can be determined. (adapted from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, pp. 219-220)\n\n\n\n7.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat is it that makes you think that someone is attractive, kind, evil, competent, upset, and the like? These resources will look at some of the factors that contribute to how you judge others and yourself. The first article outlines some of the ways your face has shaped your social experiences. The second article adds to this discussion by looking at how willing people are to acknowledge the role of attractiveness in their own thought processes and decision-making. Next, the topic shifts to altruism. The first of these articles proposes that only reciprocal altruism exists. Again, I would encourage you to read this article through the lens of, “Is it truly possible to know another’s motivation or intention?” Lastly, Random Acts of Kindness is a website that offers great resources and opportunities to increase kindness in your, and others, lives. I encourage you to participate in some of these activities to see how it makes you feel.

Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course. Type the correct answer in the boxes below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRead through the following questions and reflect on what you have learned:\n\nWhat do you think contribute to you being able to quickly judge whether or not you think someone is attractive?\nSome social psychologists believe that there is always a reward for helping and that this motivates people to help. In other words, people never help without expecting a reward of some kind (either in this life or in the next). What do you think?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "text": "8.1 Biology of Emotion\nHave you ever been embarrassed? Of course, we all have! Embarrassment is a good example for trying to sepa­rate biological, psychological, and social elements of an emotion. These correspond to blushing (biological), feeling embarrassed (psychological), and violation of a social norm (social). Now back to your embarrassing moment: Which came first, blushing, feeling embarrassed, awareness of your faux pas? Which followed next? Last?\nThe close connection between our minds and our bodies usually makes it difficult to tell whether our bodily emotional response comes before or after our psychological emotional response. This is why even psychologists have disagreed on whether you run from danger because you are afraid, or are afraid because you are running from danger.\n\nLie Detectors\nThe close connection between mind and body is the basis for so-called “lie-detectors.” Of course, they do not detect lies but physical responses to cognitive information. While their “hit” rate is better than a coin toss, lie detectors can accuse the in­nocent and vindicate the guilty. Moreover, some experts claim there are simple techniques for beating the ma­chine.\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat do you think…could you beat a lie detector device? This activity will allow you to delve more deeply into the physiological aspects of human emotion (though, cognitions and behaviours do influence physiological processes) and how they can be monitored using a polygraph machine. To learn more about Lie Detectors, follow the link below:\n\nHow Lie Detectors Work\n\nThe reason polygraph machines can work better than flipping a coin is because they are measuring responses that often occur automatically and can be difficult, though not impossible, to bring under voluntary control.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Activity: Question for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a moment to consider what you have learned and reflect on the following question:\n\nHow many ancient or old-fashioned methods for telling if someone is lying can you find on the internet?\n\nOften a person’s life depended on these highly questionable methods.\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "section": "8.2 Communicating Emotion",
    "text": "8.2 Communicating Emotion\nBy now you know something about the physical responses involved in emotions, and you have given some thought to our responses to our emotions. However, a very important part of the study of emotions is the way that we communicate them. “I feel angry,” we say. But the way we say it also carries a message. Just stop for a minute and think about how many different ways (“channels” communication experts call them) we use to communicate emotions. We use our faces, our bodies, the tone and volume of our voice; in writing we use words but we also use punctuation marks (). And what about e-mail? How many ways can you find that we use to show our emotions in e-mail? (Hint: What are emoticons?)\n\nHow Many Facial Expressions?\nThe study of emotion has long been linked with the study of facial expressions. Psychologists have been interested in the way in which people express emotion and whether these facial expressions reliably convey the emotional message. Stud­ies by Ekman and others have raised a contemporary interest in emotional expression. It appears that there are some universal aspects of emotion across a number of cul­tures. Seven emotions have been consistently identified: happi­ness, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, and surprise. However, questions remain about whether this is a complete spectrum of emotion and whether there are cul­ture-specific aspects of facial emotion expression. What can you find on the internet concerning the number of possible facial emotional expressions?\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIs there a practical use to understanding how we communicate emotions? Yes, actually there are several possible uses. One very interesting use is in the understanding of deception. For as long as we have records, we know that people have understood that liars don’t seem to be able to control all of their communication channels. Verbally, they deny they are lying, but the truth screams out from eye movements; a slightly irregular smile, a faint blush…. This activity provides additional information for your consideration:\n\nBody Language Speaks Volumes\nCatching a Liar\n10 Reasons Why You Should Smile\n\nAnother possible use of understanding emotional communication better is the development of computers that can read human emotions from speech or facial expressions. This would enable far better communication between computers and their human masters.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Activity: Question for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider what you have learned in this section - reflect on the following question:\n\nDo you think that people make distinctive facial expressions when they lie?

    "section": "8.3 Experiencing Emotion",
    "text": "8.3 Experiencing Emotion\nNow that you understand what’s happening inside your body when you are angry or embarrassed, or experiencing some other emotion, maybe you can see why we often find it so hard to control our emotions. Of course this leads to the question “Should we try to control our emotions?” Or should we just accept them as natural and inevitable? What is the proper role of emotions in our life? For example, imagine you are angry, very angry. Should you suppress and deny your anger out of fear of what you might do? Or should you “blow off steam” and freely express your true feelings?\nConsider the following arguments (adapted from Philipchalk,1988, p.114 ff):\n\nWhat is the Proper Role of Emotion?\n\nNo Role\nIt is not hard to see that emotions are not only frequently unpleasant, but are also a source of conflict. Anger causes us to say things we later regret; fear of others inhibits our honesty; and even anticipated happiness may blind us to the harmful effects of our actions. We speak of being “swayed by our emotions,” indicating they caused us to do or say something we wouldn’t have done otherwise. Emotions are often unpredictable, making it difficult to arm ourselves against them. They vary with our physical and mental condition, with the amount of sleep we’ve had, our blood sugar level, and a host of environmental factors. They have a clear physiological “animal-like” component. And they are part of our fallen nature. Paul warns us, “Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal. 5:24). No doubt Paul recognized that emotions arising from our physical bodies frequently play an important role in leading us to “practice the very evil that I (we) do not wish” (Rom. 7:19). Surely such an unpredictable and potentially dangerous influence should be discounted in favor of our more God-like rational faculties; isn’t the “cool intellect” superior to the “hot-head?”\nFurthermore, since emotions are such an elusive and private matter, the direction they give to behavior is easily misinterpreted, sometimes with disastrous results. For example, we might misinterpret physiological arousal as attraction. (Psychologists Dutton and Aron (1970) found that male subjects meeting an attractive woman on a high bridge felt more attracted to her than subjects meeting her on a lower bridge). Or we might misinterpret our physical attraction as love. (Psychiatrist Scott Peck (1978) argues that the experience of “falling in love” is inevitably sexual). Particularly important for Christians is the danger of misinterpreting an emotional response as the voice of God. Some Christians frequently attempt to determine God’s will by looking for an inner feeling. They may even base life-changing decisions on fleeting inner impressions of peace, unsettledness, or excitement. This can be extremely dangerous. Such feeling may be little more than expressions of their own inner wishes or fears, or simply physiological arousal that has been mislabeled.\nTo summarize, emotions are unreliable, easily misinterpreted, and a tool for possible manipulation. They are deeply rooted in our animal-likeness—our physical bodies. As such they should be brought into subjection and perhaps ignored or entirely minimized. In short, it would appear from these considerations that emotions should have no legitimate role in the regulation of behavior.\n\n\nImportant Role\nThe first thing to note with regard to the importance of emotion is that they appear to be part of God’s design for us. God has chosen to form us as emotional beings as well as rational and volitional ones. Although we are fallen, and therefore our capacities of thought and will, as well as our emotional responses, are imperfect, we are created in God’s image nevertheless. The bible ascribes emotions to God. Although some people may dismiss these references as anthropomorphisms, God certainly acts as thought He felt emotions like anger, sadness, and joy. Furthermore, Jesus took on an emotion-feeling body, and expressed a full range of emotions (possibly more than most men in contemporary Western culture). In addition, the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23) includes several blessings with strong emotional components (e.g., joy, peace). Whatever their weaknesses, emotions cannot be dismissed as wholly sinful.\nOne of the important early findings of modern psychology was the discovery that emotions must not be completely ignored. To deny and suppress them is to court harm. This does not mean that we should give free expression to every feeling we have. Psychological health doesn’t require that we blowup in anger every time that someone crosses us. But neither should we deny, especially to ourselves, that we are angry. Anger can be redirected to constructive ends; it can be controlled through cognitive strategies such as refusing to dwell on the situation that produced it. The Apostle Paul seems to take a similar position when he says, “Be angry and yet do not sin” (Eph. 4:26), indicating that while anger is probably inevitable, the sinful response in thought or behavior is not.\nOf course there is a positive side to emotions. They provide the flavor, the resonance, the texture, and the color in an otherwise dull existence. One of the main features that distinguish a person from a machine, which might be capable of many human feats, is the person’s sentient or feeling ability, the person’s capacity to experience emotion. Emotions are the source of much that is pleasant and good in life. Christians find joy and peace in serving God. Even so-called negative emotions have their value. We can direct hatred towards evil; anger can motivate us to overcome injustice; and fear can drive us to God.\nThus emotions are an inevitable part of the God-ordained human condition. They provide the highs as well as the lows in our experience, and their recognition (although not necessarily their uncontrolled expression) is necessary for our health. Although they may frequently lead us astray, and may potentially be the source of unwanted influence, we are fallen creatures, and our other faculties, rational and volitional, are also imperfect. Emotions must be trained. As C.S. Lewis noted, we must be educated to “feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, likable, disgusting, and hateful” (The Abolition of Man, [1943] 1978, p.15). For Lewis, trained emotion not the lack of emotion is the essential mark of the virtuous person. The maturing person will show greater and greater appropriate emotionality.\nDespite controversy at the theoretical level concerning the exact relationship between our thoughts and other components of emotions, the work of Stanley Schacter and Jerome Singer - see Schachter-Singer Theory of Emotion has clearly indicated the importance of mental responses. We probably have the potential for a great deal more control over our emotions than we usually admit.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow well do you handle your emotions? If you are finding that you are being led emotionally in directions that are not the best for your life or you find that you’re avoiding your emotions, it may be time to find out how to make your emotions work for you.

Positive coping increases resilience—the ability to recover from adversity, and even benefit from the experience, as is the case with post-traumatic growth. Whereas, coping via negative affectivity and pessimism can have both psychological and physiological disadvantages. Finally, you will be advised as to how religion/spirituality, relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems which can lead to human flourishing.",

    "text": "9.2 Aggression, Submission, and Assertion\nMuch of the stress we experience comes from problems we have with other people. Unfortunately, many people see only two alternatives in dealing with interpersonal conflict: aggression or submission. Are there other ways? Assertiveness represents a third alternative but one that is often confused with aggression. Assertive statements are not attacks. Rather, they communicate one’s own perceptions and emotions. Such responses often take the form of “I-statements”: I feel _________ when you do _________. Being assertive tends to defuse conflict situations because it gives both parties more complete information to work with—so it helps alleviate stress.\n\n\n9.2.1 Activity: Personal Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNow that you have some understanding concerning the differences between aggression, submission, and assertion, look at the situations below and devise all three kinds of responses to each one. Be prepared to share your insights with other members of the class\nSituation #1: Someone is crowding in front of you in line at the grocery store.\n\nAggressive Response: _________________\nSubmissive Response: _________________\nAssertive Response: _________________\n\nSituation #2: After a physical exam the doctor gives you a prescription without telling you what the diagnosis is, what the medicine is for, or what the side effects might be. When you ask for this information, the doctor brushes off your question.\n\nAggressive Response: _________________\nSubmissive Response: _________________\nAssertive Response: _________________\n\nSituation #3: A boyfriend or girlfriend wants to end your relationship.\n\nAggressive Response: _________________\nSubmissive Response: _________________\nAssertive Response: _________________\n\nSituation #4: The boss tells you that your work has been of poor quality and that you will shape up or be fired.\n\nAggressive Response: _________________\nSubmissive Response: _________________\nAssertive Response: _________________\n\nSituation #5: You have received a grade that is much lower than you feel you deserved on an essay examination.*\n\nAggressive Response: _________________\nSubmissive Response: _________________\nAssertive Response: _________________\n\nFinally, consider the following:\n\nAre any of your responses affected by your religious beliefs? How so?\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the following question - how does it connect to what you have learned in this section:\n\nEach of us has some minor annoyances that add to our stress level more than they should. What gets you stressed out? What are your everyday “pet peeves” (annoyances)? Does the stress that these things produce seem justified? What are some things you can do to decreases your stress responses to these situations?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "section": "9.3 Health Psychology",
    "text": "9.3 Health Psychology\nAs mentioned in the Overview, health psychologists study both positive and negative impacts that humans’ behaviour and decisions have on their health, survival, and well-being. Below are a couple of examples describing the impact of having some form of reward that perpetuates the use of a behaviour (whether healthy or unhealthy) and the power of remaining committed to making the changes you want to see.\n\nA primary concern of health psychology is not to find new cures, but to get peo­ple to use the solutions that are available. Smoking, drug use, overeating, and gambling are just some of the destructive behaviors in which people engage be­cause they say they don’t have the willpower to quit. We might say because they want to engage in them. Why? Generally, we have to conclude that there are rewards for engaging in these behaviors. You might want to examine some of your behaviors, especially ones that could be considered “maladaptive”, in light of what rewards are maintaining them.\nE. Scott Geller has written extensively in the area of motivating healthful behav­ior. His research covers alcohol use, driving while impaired, highway safety, and seat belt use. For several years he has personally carried on a campaign to get air­lines to make a seat belt announcement at the end of each flight (Geller, 1989). Sometime during the flight Geller gives a pilot or flight attendant a small card.\n\nIn addition to attractive graphics, the card contains the following message:\nAirline Announcement - Now that you have worn a seat belt for the safest part of your trip, the flight crew would like to remind you to buckle-up during your ground transportation.\nGeller reports that in one 4 1/2 year time period, for 33.7 percent of the flights on which he gave out this card, the requested announcement was made. Some air­lines even made the buckle-up reminder a regular part of their end-of-flight an­nouncements. On the other hand, one airline distributed a memo to its staff stating “ignore the request of the Virginia Tech professor with the blue card.” Geller had his cards reprinted on yellow stock and continued to distribute the requests! Geller, E. S. (1989). The airline lifesaver: In pursuit of small wins. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 22(3)\nThis summary of Geller’s past activities demonstrates that with motivation and persistence, you can change not only your own behaviours, but also, those of large corporations. If you have been on an airplane recently, you have likely noticed that the universally communicated announcement to have your seatbelt fastened during landing and transport back to the terminal.\n\n\n9.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this activity you will watch Dr. Kelly McGonigal’s TED talk titled, “How to Make Stress your Friend.” This video is groundbreaking research to help people transform their perspective on stress:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter watching the video, take a few minutes to read about Dr. Gil Greengross’ research that challenges the widely held belief that humour is good for your health. Here is the link to his Psychology Today article:\n\nPsychology Today\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Activity: Chapter 14 Key Terms Quiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 14 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReflect on the following questions:\n\nWho is ultimately responsible for how you react to different situations and circumstances in your life? How do you know this?\nIs there a good time to just laugh something off?\nWhat are some potential stress related consequences of habitually turning to humour when dealing with stress?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "text": "10.1 Looking at What is Normal and Anxiety Disorders\nWe begin this topic by considering the following excerpt:\nI avoid it whenever I can. In fact, I fear those days in which I have to experience it—going to the dentist. I know this is a common fear, but the reason for my fear is different from most people’s. When I go to the dentist, I pace back and forth in the waiting room, my heart races, I start to sweat and I have some trouble breathing. I know some people have problems with needles, or drills—not so for me. You see, my problem is with X-rays. I know, you are probably thinking, “what could be the problem with x-rays—this guy must really be a baby”. Well, the problem is that I have one of the strongest gag reflexes that my dentist has ever seen (at least so he tells me). When the dentist puts the lead backing in my mouth (you know the cardboard thing that makes sure you don’t get cancer, or brain damage, or produce deformed children–at least this is what my dentist tells me), I choke on the piece and gag it up. In addition to being terribly uncomfortable, it is highly embarrassing—not to mention a little scary for all those children in the waiting room listening to the guy “dying” in the dentist’s chair. My dentist has tried everything—cutting the backing so it is smaller, having a nurse talk to me to distract my attention, having a nurse down the hall flip the X-ray switch as soon as the backing is in my mouth. Nothing seems to work, and over the past 20 years of going to the dentist, I have become more and more anxious with the experience. Only one solution has seemed to work—letting me put the backing in my mouth myself and taking the picture really fast. (TWU psychology professor, personal communication)*\n\nWhat is Normal?\nAs the textbook points out, the definition of what is normal varies depending on culture and circumstances. As you read about various disorders, you may be struck by how similar “disordered” behavior is to normal behavior. (You should also beware of the “medical student syndrome;” the tendency to feel you have the problem you are studying.) In fact, disordered thought and behavior is usually just exaggerated normal behavior perhaps displayed at inappropriate times. For example, how would you diagnose someone who walks back and forth waving his arms and shouting one minute, and sits down and weeps uncontrollably the next? You might think he had a serious mental problem…*that is until you found out he was a basketball coach on the sidelines of a big game\nHere is a list of comparisons between normal personality characteristics on the left, and the same type of behavior classified as a personality disorder on the right (originally published in Harper’s, February 1997, by L.J. Davis). You will learn more about personality disorders in a later section, but for now, you can probably see that the right, “disordered” column could just represent a different perspective on the left, “normal” column:\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage of chart listing of personality style and personality disorder\nThis is not to say that psychological diagnoses have no validity. The point is that diagnosis is difficult and sometimes controversial.\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following articles augment your understanding of the descriptions of the disorders discussed in the textbook and provide opportunity to understand more about anxiety disorders. Due to the pervasiveness of disorders, especially anxiety related problems, this information could prove invaluable in helping yourself and others find hope and help in challenging circumstances. There is also an excellent write up on the many valid criticisms of being overly dependent on the DSM as a resource.\n\nUnderstanding Psychological Disorders\nWhat are Anxiety Disorders\nCriticism of America’s Diagnostic Bible - The DSM\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider what you have learned in this section. Use the following questions to guide your reflection:\n\nWould you expect Christians to be more mentally healthy than non-Christians? Why or why not?\nWhat about people with other religious/spiritual beliefs?\nWhat about people with no religious/spiritual beliefs?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

She seemed to live a normal, uneventful life. Her family, however, was living a private hell. At times, Jane would be so depressed that she didn’t want to get out of bed. She would mope around the house. She didn’t want to see anyone or visit anyone. Her children and husband tried to lift her spirits, but their efforts were all in vain. She believed she was worthless, useless, and her life was meaningless. At other times, Jane was the life of the party. She would make great plans to change the world. She would give huge sums of money to charity and she would go on pointless, spending frenzies. Her husband was forced to cancel their credit cards for fear of personal bankruptcy. When Jane found out about the cards being cancelled she reacted violently. She told her husband that he was old, ugly and worthless, and that she could be with anyone she wanted. In fact, she stated that all the young men are staring at her—“If I wasn’t a committed Christian, I’d be leave you to be with one of those young men, they all want me.” Her family could no longer stand Jane’s mood swings—she was either “pathetic” or “unbearable”. After years of mood fluctuations, Jane was finally diagnosed as suffering from Bipolar Mood Disorder. Following medical treatment and counselling, Jane’s moods stabilized and the family was again able to live peacefully.",

Brenda Penninx, a gerontologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and colleagues followed 2,847 people over 55—both with and without heart disease—for four years to trace the effects of depression.\nIn the end, people with major depression were at least three times as likely as patients who were not depressed to die of heart disease. Even subjects with mild depression experienced a fatality rate that was 50 percent higher than normal.\nPenninx isn’t sure exactly what the connection is, but since depression can raise stress, and stress triggers an outpouring of the hormone cortisol, this could cause heart rate and blood pressure to rise. Other factors could play a part: Depressed people are less likely to exercise or eat right than those who don’t suffer from the malady. “Depression deserves a lot more attention than it usually gets,” Penninx warns. “It’s a huge cardiac risk factor, so it’s crucial to take care of your emotions.”“ —Health (Quoted in Readers Digest, Feb. 2002, p. 27)*\n\n\n10.4.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow do you know the difference between depression and normal sadness?

    "section": "10.5 Schizophrenia",
    "text": "10.5 Schizophrenia\nSchizophrenia is one of the more devastating psychological illnesses. Schizophrenia is not common, however, it seems to be universal, appearing in cultures all over the world and across history. Some of our earliest writings describe people who seem to have lost touch with reality, who “hear voices,” and who produce bizarre speech and behaviours. At some earlier times in history, a person experiencing such symptoms may have been suspected of demon possession or some form of witchcraft. At other times and places, such people might be revered as shamans or as having special connections to the spirit world, and may well have played important roles in the community. Importantly, spiritual contributions to schizophrenia’s symptoms are still considered in some religious and cultural interpretations of this disorder.\n\nSchizophrenia in the Bible\nBut when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. Daniel 5:20-21\nThe bible gives relatively few accounts of people troubled by mental illness as we would call it today. The above account is of Belshazar, son of Nebuchadnezzar who was killed after losing his mental faculties. Interestingly, his father, Nebuchadnezzzar seemed to suffer from a similar loss of functioning:\nO King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken, The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kngdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did eat grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws. Daniel, 4:31b-33\n\n\nThe Split in Schizophrenia\nThis strange behavior and apparent loss of contact with reality we would probably consider schizophrenia today. Schizophrenia appears in all cultures at about the same rate. Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and debilitating of the psychological disorders. As mentioned in the textbook, schizophrenia is often confused with dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder, popularly known as split personality). Schizophrenics do not have a split personality. And it is not correct to refer to someone with a “split personality” as schizophrenic.

    "text": "10.6 Personality Disorders\nPersonality disorders are relatively common disorders where the person can function normally, but shows evidence of some difficulty or abnormality in social functioning. Unlike other disorders, the person does not seem to feel there is a difficulty.\n\nAntisocial Personality\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. It can be seen in individuals who have a profound lack of empathy or emotional connection with others, a disregard for others’ rights or preferences, and a tendency toward imposing their own desires, often violently, onto others regardless of the consequences for other people or, often when younger, other animals. APD (sometimes referred to as psychopathy) tends to be highly resistant to treatment, in part because individuals with APD are not alarmed or distressed by their actions (although others frequently are), and they are thus rarely, if ever, motivated to change. The following is a short example to illustrate how some people who suffer from APD might present themselves:\nA former professor at UBC, Dr. Robert Hare (an internationally known expert on antisocial personality disorders) often conducted research with prisoners diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. He frequently took graduate students with him to prison to assist in this research. To illustrate the ability of the prisoners to “con” even bright graduate students, he told them that on the way back from prison inevitably the students would tell him that the prisoner they had been dealing with was innocent. They were sure there had been a mistake, and the prisoner had been falsely convicted. Such is the charm and persuasive power of the antisocial personality.\n\n\n\n10.6.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRecall from Chapter 12 that our personalities allow others to predict and anticipate our responses to situations. A person with a “healthy” personality demonstrates a range of coping responses and styles when placed in a stressful situation. However, a disordered personality does not have this kind of adaptability and flexibility. At times, the person doesn’t feel they like they have any problems, at other times, the lack of adaptability and the limited repertoire of coping responses can result in distress for the person and for those around him or her. In this activity, you can gain more insight into defined patterns of personality disorders.\n\nPersonality Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n10.6.2 Activity: Chapter 15 Key Terms Quiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 15 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.6.3 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nDo you ever wonder if someone you know seems to have a personality disorder? What are some indications that you have seen that make you curious if there may be a problem? (If you don’t know anyone personally, you can describe someone you know about or have seen in a movie/TV show.)\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

    "text": "11.1 Therapies- Part 1\n\nPsychological Therapies\nPsychological therapies, or psychotherapies, are a general class of therapies that deal with the psychological (mental/behavioural) world of people with disorders.\nThese therapies are generally contrasted with biomedical approaches, which deal more with the biological world of the individual. Biomedical therapies focus on altering a person’s biology to effect a change in the person’s psychology.\n\n\nEclectic Approach\nThe eclectic approach is an approach that values the diversity of treatment approaches. Eclectic approaches deal with psychology and biology. In addition, various types of psychotherapies may be employed. Eclectic therapy approaches are becoming very popular.\n\n\nA Sin Problem?\n*“Many Christians are not satisfied with viewing psychological disorders as either illnesses or nothing but thought and behavior problems. They feel that both of these approaches are inadequate because they omit very important moral and spiritual questions. Consequently, the important issue of moral responsibility is not dealt with adequately.\nThey feel that since humanity’s most basic problem is alienation from God as a result of sin, no other difficulty can be dealt with until the relationship with God has been restored. Thus the first goal of therapy is to bring the client to the place of acknowledging his or her need, and asking for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Once the client has placed his or her trust in God, and is operating within the same religious conceptual framework as the therapist, therapy can then proceed to the identification of specific disturbances of thought and behavior. These are seen as examples of sin in that the individual is either acting in a sinful way towards others, or is harboring sinful thoughts and attitudes within. The therapist will assist the individual to identify, confess, and forsake these sins. The goal of therapy is seen primarily in terms of spiritual growth and a “closer walk with God.”*\n\n\nSin Only?\nIn a work for Christian counselors, Koteskey (1983) gives the example of his eighteen month old son who developed an intense fear of dogs after two unpleasant experiences with them. Even the fact that the child was too young to talk did not prevent a fellow Christian psychologist from concluding that he had a spiritual problem. We should recognize that not every problem is necessarily a spiritual one. Just as a disturbance may have a purely biological cause, so too it may have a simple psychological (learning) explanation. Information gained from the study of animals may be helpful in the understanding of psychological problems as it is often vital in understanding biological problems. (Both excerpts from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk)\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor many people unfamiliar with the journey of counselling, finding suitable resources may feel daunting. It is important to know that there are many different approaches designed to help you accomplish the growth goals you have for your life. In this activity, the first resource, Psych Central is the oldest peer-reviewed psychology and mental health network on the Internet. Established in 1992, originally it was an index to mental health. Now it gives you the opportunity to see some treatment options for a wide variety of conditions. Additionally, there is a resource on different theoretical approaches to behavior change, and a link to some information concerning the integration of Christianity and psychotherapy.\n\nPsychCentral\nBehaviour Online\nIntegration Models\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Activity: Questions for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRead the questions below and consider how they connect to what you have learned:\n\nWhat is your view of the role of sin (or questionable moral behaviours) or other religious/spiritual beliefs in the treatment of psychological disorders?\nWhat kinds of religious/spiritual beliefs could lead to greater feelings of guilt/shame and increased psychological disorder?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class.",

    "section": "12.1 Evaluating Therapy",
    "text": "12.1 Evaluating Therapy\n\nTherapy?\nIn a previous chapter, we looked at various ways of understanding personality. In the first part of this chapter we have been considering different therapies that grow out of these personality theories. Now it is time to ask the question, “Does it work? Is psychotherapy effective?” The answer seems to be “Yes,” but there are qualifications. First, many people who do not receive treatment get better anyway. And second, placebo treatments also produce improvements, as do non-professional caring relationships. As David Myers says,\n“All types of psychotherapy seem to offer three benefits: new hope, a fresh perspective, and an empathic, trusting, caring relationship.” (p. 592)\nWhen you stop and think about it, isn’t this what a good friend offers? Maybe if we all experienced (and offered) this kind of friendship, therapists wouldn’t be so much in demand.\n\n\nTherapy in Other Cultures\nThe process of psychotherapy generally assumes a cultural value of sharing your inner feelings and problems with another individual. David Ho observes that in the culture of Hong Kong, it is a sign of weakness to talk about one’s problems and to reveal much of one’s self. This cultural background influences the style of therapy and the process of psychotherapy. How would you proceed if you were a therapist?\nPaul Pedersen (1985; 1987; 2000) suggests that we do not need to look at cultures outside North America to see differences in the process of psychotherapy. He sug­gests that different sub cultural minorities within North America approach psy­chotherapy with different values and different expectations. Native North American cultures, Asian immigrants, Hispanics, and Afro-Americans have different approaches to the pro­cess of psychotherapy. A therapist needs to be aware of these cultural differ­ences to perform effectively in the therapeutic situation.\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this activity gives you an opportunity to explore the American Psychological Association (APA) website. In many ways, the APA leads the discipline and profession of psychology. It is an excellent resource for finding information on a number of areas of psychology, contemporary issues in psychology, a plethora of resources for self-help. They also have the opportunity for students to become student affiliates and enjoy member privileges that will contribute to your development as a professional. Follow the link below:\n\nAmerican Psychological Association\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Activity: Question for Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the following:\n\nDo you think an empathic, trusting, caring friend could be as effective as a trained psychotherapist or counselor?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class",

    "section": "12.2 Biological Treatments",
    "text": "12.2 Biological Treatments\nThough there are a number of treatments options within the field of psychology, there are two basic treatment models:\n\nThe Wellness Model\nThe Medical Model.\n\nThe Wellness Model will look intently, and holistically, at a number of areas of a person’s life (thoughts/emotions, relationships, work/academics, developmental stage, nutrition, activity/leisure, and sleep, to name a few) and illuminate the client’s strengths and resources to help them find a way to overcome challenges and lead a more fulfilling life. Many of the psychotherapeutic approaches looked at, thus far, operate on this model.\nThe Medical Model, however, is based on symptom recognition, (differential) diagnosis, prognosis, and often a pharmacological support and possibly an invasive or non-invasive procedure. The topic of biological treatments is based on the medical model.\n\nMedical Treatments\nAlthough psychotherapy in its various forms has grown in importance over the past generation, people are still more inclined to seek the help of medical professionals over mental health professionals for their psychological concerns. One of the greatest changes in the way we have treated psychological disorders has been through the discovery and use of various drugs. In this section, we consider the various biomedical therapies that are available for psychological disorders.\n\n\nNot a Panacea\nAll of the biological therapies produce side effects, some of them permanent. Since the brain cannot regenerate itself, psychosurgery is irreversible; ECT destroys brain cells, producing memory loss, some of which is permanent; virtually all drugs have side effects besides the dependency produced, and some of these are permanent. (For example, one class of antipsychotic drugs, the phenothiazines, can produce a permanent and irreversible muscle disorder, particularly after massive long-term use. This disorder, called tardive dyskinesia, is evidenced by involuntary movements of the face, limbs, and trunk.) Furthermore, the unknown basis of the effects of many of these techniques (e.g., ECT, and some drugs), and the exploratory nature of others (psychosurgery) should make us at least a little skeptical. (A further controversy surrounding the use of physiological therapies, particularly, ECT, concerns their forced administration to involuntary patients.)\n\n\n\n12.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important, when considering biological treatments, to receive input from more than one professional and to do adequate research on the treatment to understand the potential risks and benefits. This activity serves as a resource for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as treatments for depression. It also has a link to explore an alternative therapy known as neurotherapy/neurofeedback, which is a safe (when administered by a well-trained professional), non-invasive option for a number of different developmental and psychological matters. To learn more, read below:\n\nElectroconvulsive Therapy and Other Depression Treatments\nInternational Society for Neuroregulation and Research\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions in context of what you have learned about in this section:\n\nAs biological influence in psychological disorders becomes more obvious, what are the implications for psychologists and “talk therapy?”\nWill biological therapies eventually replace old style talk therapies?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class",

Here, we take a more personal look at how you might go about dealing with major problems or just simple blockages in your pathway to growth.\nWe all need help from time to time, whether we get it from family, friends, or paid professionals. Professional help can be a real boost. It might be testing to clarify career directions, sharing a relationship issue with a sympathetic listener, or in-depth study of a long-term problem. A trained helper provides an objective perspective and an empathic ear.\n\nAn Ounce of Prevention\nBeing aware of the possible causes of psychological problems as well as the appropriate treatments can help you avoid similar difficulties in your own life. For example you can:\n\nNot bury and deny strong emotions (psychodynamic view)\nTake responsibility for your feelings & promote growth (humanistic view)\nAssociate positive consequences with desirable actions and negative results with undesirable ones (behavioral view)\nAvoid negative self-talk in favor of positive (cognitive view)\nCultivate empathic, trusting, caring relationships\nTake steps to ensure a healthy body\n\n\n\n\n12.3.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLooking intently at how you are spending your time and taking preventative steps to contribute to your mental/emotional health and overall well-being is a great gift to give to yourself (and ultimately others).
