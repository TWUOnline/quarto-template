It is manual work, so please send in content early. For next iteration, we will add a carousell format to it.\nPlease note that the quiz response is not saved. Below is a shortened version. For existing course examples, see LDRS 504 5.2.2 and 5.5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions: For each statement below, rate how often you personally engage in or observe these behaviours in your groups or teams. Use this scale:\n1 = Rarely or never 2 = Sometimes 3 = Often 4 = Almost always\n\n\n1. Listen carefully to others, seeking to fully understand their message, including emotions and intent, before responding.\n\n\n Rarely or never Sometimes  Often Almost always\n\n\n\n2. I avoid communication that makes others feel defensive, such as criticizing or controlling language.\n\n\n Rarely or never Sometimes  Often Almost always\n\n\n\n3. I am aware of my own emotions during group interactions and try to manage them constructively.\n\n\n Rarely or never Sometimes  Often Almost always\n\n\n\n4. I encourage open discussion of different viewpoints, even when there is disagreement or conflict.\n\n\n Rarely or never Sometimes  Often Almost always\n\n\n\n5. I welcome and respect minority opinions or dissenting views in group decisions.\n\n\n Rarely or never Sometimes  Often Almost always\n\n\n\nHow to Interpret Your Results\nStep 1: Calculate Your Average Score\nAdd your scores for all 5 statements and divide them by 5 to find your average.\nStep 2: Reflect on Your Average\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Score\nInterpretation\nReflection Questions\n\n\n\n\n3.5 – 4.0\nConsistently Ethical\n\n\n\nYou regularly practice behaviours that promote ethical and effective group interactions. Keep reinforcing these strengths!\nWhat specific habits help you maintain this level? How can you support others in your group?\n\n\n\n2.5 – 3.4\nModerate Practice\n\n\n\nYou sometimes engage in these ethical behaviours but there is room for growth.\nWhich areas do you notice the most inconsistency? What small changes can you make to improve?\n\n\n\n1.0 – 2.4\nNeeds Attention\n\n\n\nYou rarely or only occasionally use these behaviours, which may hinder ethical group dynamics.\nWhat barriers prevent you from practicing these behaviours? What support or resources would help you develop them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Look at Individual Items Identify any statements where you scored below 3. These might be key focus areas to develop, as they represent critical aspects of ethical group interaction.\nStep 4: Set a Personal Goal Choose one or two behaviours to focus on strengthening in your next group experience. Consider how you might apply supportive communication, emotional intelligence, or encourage minority opinions more actively.\nReflection Questions (Optional)\n\nWhich of these areas do you feel strongest in?\nWhich areas could you improve to promote more ethical group interactions?\nHow might you practice supportive communication or encourage productive conflict in your next team meeting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula Example\n\n\\[\nz=\\frac{68-70}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n95\\%CI = \\text{mean} \\pm (SE \\times 1.96)\n\\]\n\n\nMermaid Examples\n\nFlowchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Actions to take] --- B[Use open peer reviews to hold people accountable.]\n   A --- C[Manage at the level of the team rather than the individual.]\n   A --- D[Provide development advice through continuous assessments.]\n    B --- E[Evaluate with the team, as a team, providing both positive and negative feedback and hearing from all parties.]\n    C --- F[Have open discussion rather than secret meetings.]\n    D --- G[Meet regularly and provide feedback often.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --&gt; Still\n    Still --&gt; [*]\n    Still --&gt; Moving\n    Moving --&gt; Still\n    Moving --&gt; Crash\n    Crash --&gt; Crash1\n    Crash --&gt; [*]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabs\nTabs are only compatible with content displayed on Quarto site, not Moodle.\n\nTab ATab B\n\n\n\nArtists have an uncanny ability to make things seem real. The potential for ‘trompe-l’oeil’ like this train coming out of the wall seemed as dangerous to the ancients as portraying something imperfectly and thus damaging our understanding of it. Art is out of control!\n\n\n\nSome ancients believed art functioned like a false front, only showing part of something or being inherently deceitful.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit you may want to check that you are able to:\n\nDescribe the place of leadership in results\nExplain the discipline of results-based leadership\nContrast a team-based leadership style with other approaches to leadership",
