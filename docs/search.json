    "text": "Assignment Feedback & Outcome-Based Assessment\nYour progress in this course will be assessed based on how well you demonstrate proficiency in the course learning outcomes (CLOs), which are equally weighted. Rather than focusing on point-based grading, this course uses an outcome-based assessment approach, which means:\n\nYou will complete a series of learning activities and assignments that provide opportunities to demonstrate your understanding of the CLOs.\nYour work will be evaluated holistically, considering how well you meet the learning outcomes rather than simply accumulating points.\nYou will be asked to exercise evaluative judgment, meaning you will reflect on your own work, assess your level of proficiency, and provide evidence of your learning.\nYour instructor will work with you to appraise your progress, offering feedback to help you deepen your understanding and refine your work.\n\nTo measure proficiency, we use a proficiency scale that helps both learners and instructors assess whether assignments are completed at an appropriate level. This scale includes five levels of proficiency: Not Demonstrated, Emerging, Developing, Proficient, and Extending. Each level reflects the depth of understanding and application of the course learning outcomes.\nThis approach ensures that assessment is focused on growth, reflection, and mastery rather than simply grading tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Demonstrated\nEmerging\nDeveloping\nProficient\nExtending\n\n\n\n\nThe learner does not demonstrate the outcome at a level that is assessable.\nThe student demonstrates an initial understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning.\nThe student demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning.\nThe student demonstrates a complete understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning.\nThe student demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the concepts and proficiencies relevant to the expected learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback will be communicated with you in two different ways. First, and most important, there will be at least two assessment interviews that you will be required to attend with your instructor. During this assessment interview, you will need to highlight what you have learned and which artifacts from the course you use as evidence of your learning. You and your instructor will use the Personal Learning Tracker to guide this conversation. By the end of the conversation, you will have a clear picture and record of your level of proficiency on each of the Course Learning Outcomes addressed in that particular assignment and you will have a plan for improving your level of proficiency on future assignments.\nSecond, your instructor will record your level of proficiency on each outcome in the Moodle gradebook. It will be your responsibility to ensure that the proficiency levels shown in the Personal Learning Tracker align with what is shown in the gradebook. During the course, the Moodle Gradebook will be considered the correct record. However, your grade is not official until it is entered into the university Portal at the end of your course.",

    "text": "Grading System\n\nUnderstanding Proficiency Levels and Final Grades\nAs we mentioned previously, your progress will be assessed based on how well you demonstrate proficiency on the Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). Instead of focusing on points or percentages, this approach emphasizes your ability to apply what you’ve learned.\nYour proficiency will be evaluated at different levels, and your final grade will be based on your performance across all seven CLOs.\nYou must complete all assignments to receive a grade in this course.\nThere are two steps to determining your final grade in the course.\n\nProficiency Levels: Determining Your Learning Progress\nFirst, at the end of your course, you will have a record of your proficiency levels on each of the Course Learning Outcomes based on your work on each of the assignments. In LDRS 101, you will have three proficiency ratings for outcomes 1-7 and two proficiency ratings for outcomes 5-7. Based on that data, your instructor will determine a final rating for each outcome based on all of your attempts. The following guidelines outline how the final proficiency rating may be determined. Given the developmental nature of learning, your instructor may prioritise demonstrations of proficiency that come later in the course.\n\nExtending – You must achieve an Extending rating on at least two assessments.\nProficient – You must achieve a Proficient rating on at least two assessments.\nDeveloping – You must achieve a Developing rating on at least two assessments.\nEmerging – You must achieve an Emerging rating on at least two assessments.\nNot Demonstrated – If two or more CLOs are rated as Not Demonstrated, this level is assigned.\n\n\n\nFinal Letter Grade Aggregation\nSecond, based on their final rating for each of the outcomes, your instructor will use the following information to determine your final grade.\nYour final letter grade is determined by your proficiency across the seven CLOs:\n\nA – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at Extending, with no rating below Proficient.\nB – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at Proficient, with no rating below Developing.\nC – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at Developing, with no rating below Emerging.\nD – At least 5 of the 7 CLOs must be at Emerging, with no Not Demonstrated ratings.\nF – Assigned if 2 or more CLOs are rated as Not Demonstrated.\n\nThis grading structure ensures that your final grade reflects your overall proficiency across the course learning outcomes, rewarding both depth and consistency in your learning. It is designed to keep you actively engaged in your learning and focused on developing the skills necessary for success. If you have any questions about how your work is assessed, please reach out to your instructor.\n\n\n\nUniversity Standard Grading System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nGrade Description\n\n\n\n\nA\nOutstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower-level courses.)  Proficiency Scale: Extending\n\n\nB\nGood, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter in both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.Proficiency Scale: Proficient\n\n\nC\nAdequate, reasonably satisfactory work; fair performance but infrequent evidence of original thinking or the capacity to analyze, synthesize, or evaluate course material; undue reliance on rote memory; difficulty in applying knowledge in unfamiliar contexts; limited problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; fairly clear but quite uninspiring written expression with occasional problems in mechanics or syntax; weak in provision of documented, illustrative, or descriptive evidence; satisfactory grasp of basic elements of the course but frequent lapses in detailed understanding. Satisfies the minimum requirements of the course. Proficiency Scale: Developing\n\n\nD\nMinimally acceptable work; relatively weak performance with little evidence of original thinking or ability to analyze or synthesize course material; nominal or weak problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; written expression frequently exhibits difficulty in articulating a central thesis or sustaining a coherent argument; ideas are trite or juvenile without discernible development. Shows inadequate grasp of some basic elements of the course. Proficiency Scale: Emerging\n\n\nF\nInadequate work; poor performance that indicates a lack of understanding or misunderstanding of essential subject matter; seems easily distracted by the irrelevant; written expression is poorly organized, often incoherent, and rife with mechanical and diction errors. Shows little evidence of even basic proficiency in the course content or skills. Proficiency Scale: Not Demonstrated\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information please see the University Standard Grading System website.",

    "text": "Assessment Conversations\nThroughout the course, you will have several opportunities to elicit feedback from your instructor. We will work together to appraise your work on learning activities and assignments in light of the course learning outcomes.\nAs part of this process, you will participate in an Assessment Conversation, a scheduled meeting where you will:\n\nDemonstrate and discuss your work, showcasing how you have engaged with digital tools, built workflows, and applied digital literacy skills.\nExplain your learning process, sharing insights into how you approached assignments and developed key proficiencies.\nDefend your progress using the Personal Learning Tracker, a shared document where you will assess your proficiency in relation to the course learning outcomes.\nExercise evaluative judgment, critically analyzing your strengths, areas for growth, and next steps in your digital learning journey.\n\nThese conversations are formative, meaning they are designed to support your learning and development. They may not result in a grade on your assignment, but you will receive valuable feedback that you can use to improve your standing in the course on your next assessment.\n\nHow to Prepare for Your Assessment Conversation\n\nUse the Personal Learning Tracker: This shared document between you and your instructor aligns course learning outcomes with proficiency indicators across assignments. It helps you track your progress, evaluate your learning, and practice evaluative judgment throughout the course. Keep it updated as you complete each assignment to prepare for the conversation.\nPrepare specific questions about your work that you would like to discuss. Making a list ahead of time ensures we use our time efficiently.\nReview the course learning outcomes and take notes on how you would explain your understanding of them. This is an opportunity for self-reflection and assessment.\nReview your work: Assignments should demonstrate how you have met the targeted course learning outcomes.\nReflect on your work: Be prepared to show connections between concepts, apply them to your experiences or current events, and demonstrate personal reflection and critical thinking.\n\n\n\nBefore the Assessment Conversation\n\nTest your video and audio in Microsoft Teams to ensure everything is working correctly.\nPractice sharing your screen in Teams, as well as sharing links in the chat. (See Present content in Microsoft Teams meetings in MS Office 365 Support for guidance.)\n\n\n\nDuring the Assessment Conversation\n\nAfter a brief introduction, we will review your Personal Learning Tracker to discuss your progress and address any concerns.\nI will ask you the guiding questions, such as:\n\nOverall, how are you feeling about the course and the content?\nAre there any specific ways that I can better support your learning?\nDo you need increased accountability?\nHow are you doing in meeting the goals that you set for yourself at the beginning of the course?\n\nUse your Personal Learning Tracker to explain how your assignments demonstrate progress toward proficiency. Highlight specific indicators of proficiency that you have met and areas where you continue to grow.\nClearly explain how your assignments provide evidence of your learning in relation to the course outcomes.\nYour instructor will provide feedback to help you assess your progress, suggest improvements, and encourage further development.\nTake notes on the feedback and reflect on how you can continue to grow in each of the learning outcome areas.\n\n\n\nKey Points to Highlight During Your Conversation\nAvoid simply reading your assignments or reflections. Instead, focus on key learning moments:\n\nWhat do you want your instructor to notice?\nWhich indicators of proficiency have been met?\nWhat are you especially proud of?\nHow does your journal demonstrate evidence of learning?\n\nBy preparing thoughtfully and engaging in meaningful discussion, you will gain valuable insights into your learning progress and receive guidance to strengthen your digital literacy skills.",
